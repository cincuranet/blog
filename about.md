### Mgr. Jiří Činčura

Hello. My name is Jiří Činčura. And I write code - aka I'm a developer. 

I write code in exchange for money because that pays the bills. I also contribute to open-source software. Anything that spans data access layers, business layers, testing, databases, parallelism, debugging, operating system concepts, cloud and scaling, programming language constructs and whatever is in between. I'm a project lead for .NET provider (and related providers like Entity Framework Core, Entity Framework and DDEX) for Firebird (the database). I helped with .NET and Entity Framework providers for NuoDB. Since 2017 I'm Microsoft Most Valuable Professional.

You can find a lot of free code [here on the blog][1] and on my [GitHub][2]. If you use Firebird and like .NET, you might be interested in [FbNetExternalEngine][12] project or [FirebirdDbComparer][13]. My application [ID3 renamer][7] might help you to keep your MP3 files in order.

When not writing code I'm [speaking][3], teaching and [writing][1] about topics above. I speak at conferences, user groups, companies, ... and to whoever will listen. And write even for just a single reader. Because I like doing it.

And finally I also run and do yoga. I like running long, so called ultra, distances. Preferably in the mountains. For yoga I'm practitioner of Ashtanga yoga, because I like the connection between physical and mental self. 

I would love it if you would subscribe to [my blog's feed][4]. I'm also on social media, mostly [Twitter][5]. If you just want to email me, go ahead send your message to [jiri@cincura.net][6].

To support my work, including this blog and my open-source coding, [Github Sponsors][11] is one way to do it.
