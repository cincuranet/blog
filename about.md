### Jiří Činčura

Hello. My name is Jiří Činčura. And I write code - aka I'm a developer.

I focus on anything that spans data access layers, business layers, testing, databases, parallelism, debugging, operating system concepts, cloud and scaling, programming language constructs and whatever is in between.

I'm a long-time contributor to open-source. I've been doing it for over two decades. I'm a project lead for ADO.NET provider (and related providers like Entity Framework Core) for Firebird (the database). I work as a senior software engineer for Microsoft in .NET/performance area.

When not writing code I'm [speaking][speak], teaching and [writing][blog] about topics above. I speak at conferences, user groups, companies, ... and to whoever will listen. And write even for just a single reader. Because I like doing it.

You can find a lot of code [here on the blog][blog] and on [my GitHub][github]. If you use Firebird and like .NET, you might be interested in [FbNetExternalEngine][fbnetexternalengine] project or [FirebirdDbComparer][firebirddbcomparer]. My application [ID3 renamer][id3renamer] might help you to keep your MP3 files in order.

And finally, I also run and do yoga. I like running long, so called ultra, distances. Preferably in the mountains. For yoga I'm practitioner of Ashtanga yoga, because I like the connection between physical and mental self. But lately, I've been neglecting these hobbies.

I would love it if you would subscribe to [my blog's feed][feed]. I'm also on social media, mostly [Mastodon][mastodon][~~Twitter~~][twitter]. If you just want to email me, go ahead send your message to [jiri@cincura.net][mail].

To support my work, including this blog and my open-source efforts, [Github Sponsors][sponsor] is one way to do it.
