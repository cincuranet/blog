I was testing dimmer during the weekend and I used halogen lamp in my garage. The dimmer worked great, but that's not what I want to talk about now. When I played with the dimming I realized I can dim the 8000-9000 lumens halogen bulb down to one percent and see the glowing filament with my own eyes. So I did.

And what a stunning view it was. It's like it being disassembled in front of you. And I like disassembling.

I know I can take a picture of the filament using my DSLR and use filters and huge F stop and short time, but this was using just my eyes (although for you it's only a picture).
