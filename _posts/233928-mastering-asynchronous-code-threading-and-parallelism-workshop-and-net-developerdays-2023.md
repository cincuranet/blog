Less than a week until [.NET Developer Days 2023][1]. Can't wait to be there. This year, I'll be doing workshop and session.

<!-- excerpt -->

Let's talk about the workshop. It is called [_Mastering asynchronous code, threading and parallelism_][2]. The topics we'll cover are:

* Differences between IO async code and CPU bound code.
* Thread scheduling and scaling.
* Properly using async code.
* Understanding performance and scaling of async and threading.
* How async works under the hood.
* Basic synchronization and locking.

But this just a subset of topics. Depending on questions (and time), we can (and very likely will) steer one way or the other.

> Asynchronous code is nowadays everywhere. With the proliferation in .NET it's a tool that can be easily used to improve performance of application. It's used in frameworks under you, so good understanding is necessity and you can also employ it in your own code to benefit even further. After this workshop you'll understand what threading and async means in .NET and how it affects scaling and performance. You'll be able to make proper decision in regards to performance and also spot incorrect behavior and know where it's coming from and why it's happening. 

The session is _Debug like a pro in Visual Studio_.

> Visual Studio offers a plethora of nobs, switches and tools to make life easier when debugging. In fact there might be even too much. I'll show you my tool-belt with tools I use regularly and I'll make take your debugging skills to next level. 

Hope you'll enjoy the conference. I know I will. I'll be happy to chat with you!
