Starting tomorrow, for two days, the [Cloud Developer Days][1] is going to be held online. And it's free. I was lucky to have two sessions selected and I hope to meet you on chat.

<!-- excerpt -->

First session is _What Azure Front Door can provide for your applications_.

> Azure Front Door is relatively new product in Azure family. And although we can simply say it's a reverse proxy, it's not that simple. It's more than that and it has more features than simple reverse proxy. Caching? Anybody? Using Traffic Manager? Maybe you can replace it with better solution with Front Door. Microservices? Can help too. Interested? Great. I'll be happy to show you all of this and more.

And other is _Azure Storage (maybe) hidden features_.

> Azure Storage is a basic tool for storing your data in Azure. But it has more features than just simply that. In this session we'll check some, maybe hidden ones, that might become handy in some scenarios.
