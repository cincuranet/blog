Few moments ago I finished my session on .NET Developer Conference '21 (yeah, I forgot to make the post sooner). My session was _C# Source Generators â€“ let the machine do the programming_. It was recorded and demos are attached below.

<!-- excerpt -->

> Source Generators are one of longest requested features in C# language. What is a source generator? What I can use it for? Also what I can't use it for? Answers to these and more in this session.
