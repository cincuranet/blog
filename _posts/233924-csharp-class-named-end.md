I was today's years old when I realized I can create class named `end` in C#. 

<!-- excerpt -->

It makes sense. The `end` is not a reserved word.

```csharp
using System;

Console.WriteLine(new end());

class end { }
```

Now I'm wondering what kind of fun I could make with it... ;) And yes, it's absolutely dumb to have a class with such a name.
