The <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/firebird-conference-2012/">Firebird Conference 2012</a> is again going to happen in Luxembourg during October 26-27, 2012. And I'll be there. So if you have some questions about .NET provider for Firebird catch me.

And I'll also have two sessions:
<ol>	<li>What's new in ADO.NET provider for Firebird</li>
<li>Getting started with Firebird from .NET with ADO.NET provider for Firebird</li></ol>

And I have some interesting stuff in my bag. I think you'll like it. Either visit my sessions or wait after it's over. ;) 

See you there.
