After a lot of live and pre-recorded conference talks, I decided to try also livestreaming myself. Being a beginner, I forgot to properly announce it beforehand and hence although still livestream, for most people it will be a recording. I'll get better next time.

<!-- excerpt -->

In this livestream I decided to, kind of, showcase what you can do with [_FbNetExternalEngine_][1]. A quick and easy installation, simple function and a little procedure. Everything in command line and simple editor, no fancy tools.

And that's the livestream. Like and [subscribe][2] (I am doing it right, right?). If you have some topic, you'd like me to cover, not necessarily _FbNetExternalEngine_ related, let me know below in comments and I might do a livestream about it.
