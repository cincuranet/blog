I'll be speaking at [WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2021][1] in two weeks (June 28th - July 1st). The speaker line-up there is amazing and I'll contribute with one session of mine.

<!-- excerpt -->

The session is called "C# 9 Source Generators - let the machine do the programming" and, you guessed it, is about Source Generators in C# 9.

> Source Generators are one of longest requested features in C# language. What is a source generator? What I can use it for? Also what I can't use it for? Answers to these and more in this session.

I hope to see people from other areas (languages, frameworks, etc.) with interesting "out of the box" questions. That would make my day.
