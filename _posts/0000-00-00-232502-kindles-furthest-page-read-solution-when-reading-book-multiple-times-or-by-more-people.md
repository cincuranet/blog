[Kindle][2] has a nice feature that keeps your furthest page read synchronized across all devices. Sadly it has one or two problems. First, it's really furthest page read, hence if you start reading the book from start later again, it is still keeping the _furthest_ location, which is basically the end of the book. And similarly, if you have more Kindles under one account and more people are reading the same book. But this one is kind of expected.

Though you can reset the furthest page read easily through [Amazon support][3] (didn't tried) or by juggling with turning off and on synchronization and redownloading the book from archive (didn't tried either), I found an easy solution. Before e-books we were using bookmarks, I mean real bookmarks. Piece of paper (or some fancy materials like leather) inserted between pages where you stopped reading. Voilà. Same concept we have in Kindle. It's little bit more powerful, but the basics are same.

So my solution works like this. If stop reading, I put there a bookmark. When I later begin to read again, on different device, I simple go to last bookmark (if you have some other bookmarks further in book, you'll need to recall from excerpt which one is correct, but I believe you, as me, often end/start on "milestones" like (sub)chapters or at least paragraphs where some idea ended). Bookmarks are synchronized across devices and you can have more than one in book – good when you're reading the book with somebody else. Of course, from time to time, I remove previous bookmarks, to keep just the last one and have it clean.

Most of the time I'm reading the book only once, and then looking for specific passages, but sometimes it's just worth read it again. Knowing where I ended bothered me and asking support to reset it, isn't in my opinion good experience. But I think bookmarks are solving it pretty well.
