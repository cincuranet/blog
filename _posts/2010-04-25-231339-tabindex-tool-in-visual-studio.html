<p>I remember from old times that I was using some plug-in into <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi</a> IDE to set tab order by clicking on components in order you wanted the ordering to be. Today I was reviewing the tab ordering in <a href="http://www.id3renamer.com">ID3 renamer</a> as somebody reported in forum it's wrong. I was scared doing all the work through <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171352.aspx">Properties window</a> in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>But it turned out, that Visual Studio has this tool in the box. You can find the description <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bd16a8cw.aspx">here</a>. You'll simply select form, go to View &gt; Tab Order and click on different controls to change the ordering. You see the numbers directly in designer and go through possible options by clicking.</p>

<p>Pretty nice, don't you think?</p>
