<p>I started to using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/powershell/">PowerShell</a> in my development environment simply to learn it a little bit more (though I'm still using the old command from cmd or UNIX) and also to get out of the stone aged cmd. And because I'm using the console a lot - yep, I get used to it on UNIX/Linux machines with terminal access) I was not happy to open explorer just to issue commit or update to/from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a> (these are most common commands I'm using, together with diff in commit window).</p>

<p>And happily <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> has a utility to manage most of the basic tasks. It's called TortoiseProc. To do commit or update in current directory, you'll simply execute:</p>

<pre class="brush:plain">
tortoiseproc /command:commit /path:.
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
tortoiseproc /command:update /path:.
</pre>

<p>For a while I was happy with it. But typing it everytime or looking into history (I wish cmd/PS had Ctrl+R as bash has) was not perfect for me. So I started looking for a way to create alias in PowerShell. Some kind of alias. PowerShell, sure, has something like this, I thought. And it has - <code>Set-Alias</code>. Though, limited. If you try to create alias to command with hardcoded parameters, ...</p>
<pre class="brush:powershell">
set-alias commit "tortoiseproc /command:commit /path:."
</pre>
<p>... as I was trying, you'll not succeed. After some searching and trying I found and an idea from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Andrew-Watt/e/B001HD0UKY/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_4?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1266915476&sr=1-4">Andrew Watt</a> using a function (yes, I'm a PowerShell newbie). It's easy and convenient to wrap the command into it.</p>

<p>So finally I create PowerShell aliases for TortoiseSVN to nicely support my work from command line:</p>

<pre class="brush:powershell">
set-alias update fn_update
set-alias commit fn_commit
function fn_update {tortoiseproc /command:update /path:.}
function fn_commit {tortoiseproc /command:commit /path:.}
</pre>
