I almost forgot to announce the topics touching [ADO.NET provider for Firebird][1]. This year I have three sessions. You can find more info, and register, of course, at [firebird-conference.com][2]. Here's the list.

	<li>New features in .NET provider for Firebird
* Connecting to Firebird using .NET provider from various devices - iPad, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone,...
* Creating services for rich internet applications using Firebird and the OData protocol

So if you're interested in any of these topic, come, ask, participate. Especially hearing scenarios in what you're using the .NET provider is very valuable for me. I also like talking between sessions, I always learn something new and I'm eager to to my best to answer all questions people are asking.
