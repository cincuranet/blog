<p>Today I accidentally discovered the way to send documents into Kindle for free. It's pretty easy.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Optionally set your charge limit in your Amazon account to 0.</li>
	<li>Send your documents to &lt;your selected name&gt;@kindle.com (if your charge limit is 0) or &lt;your selected name&gt;@free.kindle.com.</li>
	<li>Optionally you'll get notice in your Kindle (as well via email) that the limit was exceeded, delete it.</li>
	<li>Connect to WiFi network (if you're not already) and in a couple of seconds your documents will be downloaded through this connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think is probably described somewhere, but who has time to read manuals, isn't it? ;)</p>
