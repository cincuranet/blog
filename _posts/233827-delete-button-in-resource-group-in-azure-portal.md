I don't know whether this has been in the portal "forever" and I never noticed or if it's a new thing. Anyway, it's a nice feature and I'm enjoying it, so I might as well share that with you.

<!-- excerpt -->

If you look bit more right on the top toolbar when in resource group, you will see a _Delete_ button (no I don't mean _Delete resource group_).

![Delete button]({{ include "post_ilink" page "button.png" }})

When you select some, hence even multiple, resources, you can use this button to easily delete those. Before, I think, you always had to jump inside these resources one by one and click _Delete_ button there. And that was PIA. Being able to do it directly from resource group itself is a great help for me, because I'm often experimenting with stuff (and often deleting complete resource group is not what I want to do during the experimentation). 

You get nice confirmation dialog, where simple _yes_ is enough and off you go.

![Delete confirmation dialog]({{ include "post_ilink" page "deleting.png" }})

Maybe it was there before, maybe not (let me know, if you know). I'm just happy I know about it now.
