Today I accidentally discovered the way to send documents into Kindle for free. It's pretty easy.

* Optionally set your charge limit in your Amazon account to 0.
* Send your documents to <your selected name>@kindle.com (if your charge limit is 0) or <your selected name>@free.kindle.com.
* Optionally you'll get notice in your Kindle (as well via email) that the limit was exceeded, delete it.
* Connect to WiFi network (if you're not already) and in a couple of seconds your documents will be downloaded through this connection.

I think is probably described somewhere, but who has time to read manuals, isn't it? ;)
