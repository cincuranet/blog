Shortly: Very.

I hate the idea of instead of triggers and I made a couple of blog posts several times. And even worse is the implementation behavior on MS SQL. And the cascade constraints are bad too. 

Let's suppose this simple definition.

<pre class="brush:sql">
create table master(id int primary key, foo nvarchar(20));
create table detail(id int primary key, id_master int not null, bar nvarchar(20));
alter table detail add foreign key (id_master) references master(id) on delete cascade;
</pre>

Nothing special. Works fine, no problems expected. Until you try to define instead of delete trigger on detail table. I.e.

<pre class="brush:sql">
create trigger tr_test on detail
instead of delete as
begin
  select 1;
  -- now the fun begins
end
</pre>

You get an nice error: <code>Cannot create INSTEAD OF DELETE or INSTEAD OF UPDATE TRIGGER 'tr_test' on table
'detail'. This is  because the table has a FOREIGN KEY with cascading DELETE or
UPDATE.</code>. What the hell??? :o Why? 

Again I got a direct proof, that in this area the MS SQL is wrong, very wrong. I would be willing to accept the limitation when I'll be doing there some <code>master</code> table manipulation (yes, as I said, cascade constraints are bad too). But this? I can hardly believe my eyes. The trigger is almost empty. Or am I missing someting on backround that limits this to work?

Another "feature" that makes me love Firebird more.
