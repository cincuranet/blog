<p>I have a small morale from today. I was writing some code that was handling searching for items base also on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx">CultureInfo</a>. Because it's a pretty straightforward object, in core of .NET Framework (it's in <code>mscorlib</code>) I was expecting to handle equality using <code>==</code> based on culture itself not the object. And of course, I was wrong. :)</p>

<p>The code below should explain it clearly (<code>CurrentUICulture</code> might be different based on your system).</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
// false
System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture == System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US");
// true
System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture.Equals(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US"));
</pre>

<p>Yep. Learning something every day.</p>
