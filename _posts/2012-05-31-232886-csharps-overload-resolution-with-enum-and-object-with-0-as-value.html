Today I faced surprising behavior once again. Completely off guard.

Let's have a code:

<pre class="brush:csharp">
static void Test(string s, object o)
{
	Console.WriteLine("object");
}

static void Test(string s, TestEnum e)
{
	Console.WriteLine("enum");
}
</pre>
<pre class="brush:csharp">
enum TestEnum
{
	Zero = 0,
	One = 1,
	Two = 2,
}
</pre>

and call it:

<pre class="brush:csharp">
Test("rrr", 0);
Test("rrr", 1);
Test("rrr", 2);
Test("rrr", -1);
Test("rrr", 100);
</pre>

What do you think you'll see? Surprisingly, at least for me, it's:

<pre class="brush:plain">
enum
object
object
object
object
</pre>

After searching for a while I found <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2006/03/29/the-root-of-all-evil-part-two.aspx">Eric Lippert's post about it</a>. Basically there's something we can call <em>magic zero</em> and this can be implicitly converted to any enum (even empty one or one without <code>0</code> value). That's the root cause of this behavior. Of course, when C# compiler sees this value in method call, it selects the more specific overload (the one with <code>TestEnum</code>) over the one with <code>object</code>.

Learning new stuff every day...
