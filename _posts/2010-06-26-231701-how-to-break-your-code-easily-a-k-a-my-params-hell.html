<p>Today I faced a behavior I have no idea exists. It's more or less ambiguity between method with some parameters and one using <code>params</code>. Why more or less? Well, because it surely described in C# specification ("best match" or something similar to it). But I hadn't know I should think about it until I was debugging weird behavior.</p>

<p>Let's start with simple class:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">
class Test
{
	public Test(params int[] foos)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("foos");
	}

	public Test(int foo, int bar)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("foo bar");
	}
}
</pre>

<p>And now some (mind blowing ;)) code:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">
new Test(1);
new Test(1, 2);
new Test(1, 2, 3);
</pre>

<p>If you see the code in the context you probably spot the problem easily. The second row will not call the <code>params</code> but the other constructor.</p> 

<p>Which is "cool" until you're doing some refactoring and you (as I did) add new constructor with <code>params</code> and everything starts behaving unexpectedly. Maybe this text will help somebody to realize this faster than I did. :D</p>
