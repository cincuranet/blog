In March [I wrote about one of the new features in Visual Studio][1], time being called Quick Search. If you look into VS2010 Beta 2 (current latest) you may be confused as there's no function called like that. Now it's called Navigate To. Luckily the shortcut is untouched - Ctrl+,. So if you wanna give it a try, look for this new name (or use the good old shortcut).
