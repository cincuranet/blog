<p>This year while I was helping <a href="http://www.nuodb.com">NuoDB</a> to <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2013-08-01-233385-nuodbs-ado-net-driver-and-entity-framework %}">improve Entity Framework support in their driver</a> I had in my head that the <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a> package for driver would be nice. But you know, ..., time flies.</p> 
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>Today the same idea popped in my head again and I decided to quickly jump into and create the package. The driver is part of the NuoDB's installation, so I just used these binaries - because these are official - and created simple pacakge. Just the driver, nothing more. The package is called <code>NuoDb.Data.Client</code> same as the namespace where the code lives.</p>

<p>Head to <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/NuoDb.Data.Client/">NuoDb.Data.Client's NuGet page</a> and download, install, enjoy.</p>
