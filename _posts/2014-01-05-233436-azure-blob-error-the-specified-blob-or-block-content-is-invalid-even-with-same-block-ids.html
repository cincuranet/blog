<p>Last week I spent fair amount of time with error <code>The specified blob or block content is invalid.</code> while uploading to Azure blob in blocks. If you do a quick googling you'll find a lot of resources about fact that the block IDs need to be same of length. With maybe more googling you'll find error codes and find <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.windowsazure.storageclient.bloberrorcodestrings.invalidblockid.aspx"><code>InvalidBlockId</code></a> might seem more appropriate for this. But this is a false path. While going through first results you'll sooner or later find quite <a href="http://gauravmantri.com/2013/05/18/windows-azure-blob-storage-dealing-with-the-specified-blob-or-block-content-is-invalid-error/">good article</a>.</p> 
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>And you'll read (read: I read) the short version saying, at that time already known fact, that the block IDs need to be of same length. I read that couple of times, checked my code even more times and my block IDs were of same length, indeed. Only after few hours I read complete article including the "long version". And then it kicked me. My block IDs were of same length <i>in the current session/run of application</i>. But as I was debugging it, I also put there bunch of blocks with "random" IDs. These were different length. Silly me. I quickly comfirmed that fetching uncommitted blocks. Bang. Deleted the whole blob and started again. And it went smoothly now.</p>

<p>So there are two morals from this. Always read whole blog post (if you're here, good job :)). And always think outside the single "run" of application you're currently writing/debugging; the state might be there.</p>
