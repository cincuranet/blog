<p>Sometimes you may need to look at the command, that's created from your i.e. LINQ query and sent to database. Let's say you have query like this:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">
var q = from m in e.master
           select m.t.Length;
</pre>
<p>You can cast the q into ObjectQuery and use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.objects.objectquery.totracestring.aspx" >ToTraceString</a> method to see the query:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">
Console.WriteLine(((ObjectQuery)q).ToTraceString());
</pre>
<p>This will show you the query, that's sent to store you're using (mainly relational database). Neat and easy.</p>
