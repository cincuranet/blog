<p>I have a strong feeling that MS SQL knows I don't like it. I don't say it's a bad database, but sometimes it's really "interesting". ;)</p>

<p>OK, so what I faced this time? Let's start with basic facts. The NULL value in database is a special value. NULL and NULL is again NULL, NULL and False is again NULL and NULL isn't equal to NULL. Two days ago I was creating a chain of records in database (which isn't too relationalish, but â€¦) and I needed unique constraint on one column. No problem you may think. So did I. But not in MS SQL.</p> 

<p>Check this example:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">
1&gt; create table test(id int primary key, foo int);
2&gt; create unique index idx_text on test(foo);
3&gt; go
1&gt; insert into test values (1, null);
2&gt; go

(1 rows affected)
1&gt; insert into test values (2, null);
2&gt; go
Msg 2601, Level 14, State 1, Server X2-001SQLEXPRESS, Line 1 Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.test' with unique index 'idx_text '.
The statement has been terminated.
</pre>

<p>What a mess! Looks like somebody in MS SQL engine team thinks NULL == NULL. After some railing, testing on Firebird and asking my friend about Oracle, I googled: <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=299229">https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=299229</a>. Looks like I'm not alone; feeling better. ;)</p> 
<p>Luckily I'm working on MS SQL 2008 and I can use filtered indices. Created unique index with where clause <code>where &lt;column&gt; is not null</code> and I'm done. But boy that was a bitter finding. Hope I'll not be punched to the face with these basics again in an at least two months.</p>
