I was recently reading the [Forerunner 920XT review][2]. The 920XT apparently does not allow you to charge the watch while in activity. I'm wondering who approved that? Even the old and cheaper series [410 allowed to do that as I wrote][1]. I know the watch is aimed at triathletes and the battery life is enough for even an Ironman triathlon if you're a bit trained, but there are longer races. Races I like participating in - ultra running (or ultra marathons if you wish). 

<!-- excerpt -->

Unless you decrease the "sampling" interval significantly any watch will hit the limit. Consider some 24 hours, 30 hours times. Anyway happy I replaced my 410 by fēnix 2 some time ago. It's a great watch, though slightly bigger. But more importantly allows you to charge and keep moving. That's all I need, basically. Show me time, distance and charge. If you can show time while charging (fēnix 2 does) even better.

So here you are. If you're searching interwebs for the information whether fēnix 2 charges in activity - **yes it does** (and you can fully operate the watch). Hope the 920XT behavior is a glitch not a trend.
