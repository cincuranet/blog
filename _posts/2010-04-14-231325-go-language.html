<p>I was looking at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnDgT73v8s">Go language presentation</a> now.</p> 

<p>The first stuff that took my attention was the C-like syntax. I really don't like it. I want my language to talk to me. There's, IMO, no reason in todays world to have identifiers and symbols from only couple of characters and using a lot of different characters from various places on keyboard.</p>

<p>Anyway what was interesting for me was the concept of <i>channels</i>, especially the mapping the to threads and attempt to effectively use system resources. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163467.aspx">APM (Asynchronous Programming Model)</a> and/or new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd235608(v=VS.100).aspx">Tasks</a> both looks similar to channels - at least from the view what it's offering, not how it's exposed into language.</p>

<p>I don't know about internals. But I'm sure, that the threading and parallelism attempts to get some reasonable programming model(s) are exponentially growing.</p>
