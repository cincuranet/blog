Today I was installing iPhone SDK (in fact that's first time I was installing something such big on Mac) and at the end of the installation the installer started optimizing system (yes, system) for installed software. :D Funny. Hopefully it was not creating new kernel. :) Just wondering, what would happen if this crashes...

<small>OK, before all Mac-friendly people will kill me, I'll make a simple statement. I'm not using Mac regularly and that's why I sometimes found something funny and why I'm making fun of it (and because I'm Windows user ;)).</small>
