After the [Belgium version][1] Techorama is going to Netherlands, in October 10-12. I was lucky [one of my session was selected][2] - _C# Source Generators - let the machine do the programming_. 

<!-- excerpt -->

> Source Generators are one of longest requested features in C# language. What is a source generator? What I can use it for? Also what I can't use it for? Answers to these and more in this session.
