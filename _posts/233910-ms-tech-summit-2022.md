I'll be speaking on [MS Tech Summit 2022][1] (online) this Friday. I'll present two sessions: _What's new in C# 11_ and _Azure Spot instances as your secret weapon_. 

<!-- excerpt -->

> C# 11 was just released. What are the new features and changes. What's practical and what's less practical. All this in this session.

> Almost everyone knows virtual machines in Azure. But with a little effort, it is possible to modify the application and use Spot instances, which can be an interesting financial alternative. In this session we will look at what Spot instances are, how they differ from common VMs and how to use them effectively.
