In less than two months (28th-29th of May 2019) the [Cloud DeveloperDays 2019][1] conference will happen. I was lucky to have two sessions selected and I hope to meet you there.

<!-- excerpt -->

First session is _Azure CosmosDB_ and the second is _High Availability Options in Azure PaaS_. If you see me, feel free to chat with me about whatever cloud/Azure/.NET related.
