We are couple of weeks from [.NET DeveloperDays 2024][1]. Really excited to be there. My main "show" there is going to be [_Mastering Entity Framework Core_ workshop][2].

<!-- excerpt -->

![Banner with discount code 'Jiri']({{ include "post_ilink" page "banner.png" }})

Let's talk about the [workshop][2]. First, the banner above shows discount code, don't forget to use it. ;) Second, why should you attend? This is a unique opportunity to learn (and ask questions) from me, who has been in the Entity Framework (Core) turmoils since 2007, wrote couple of providers, spoke about it for more than a decade and now is working on Entity Framework Core full time.

Topics include (but are not limited to):
* Database and provider configuration
* Creating and configuring model
* Inheritance, table splitting, keyless entities, shadow properties, converters, comparers, JSON mapping, complex types, ...
* Lazy loading, split queries, custom SQL queries
* Custom mapping and custom functions
* Change tracking, ID generation, transactions, concurrency, batching
