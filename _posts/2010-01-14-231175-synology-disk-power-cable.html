<p>I was recently upgrading my <a href="http://www.synology.com">Synology</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a> adding new disks and rebuilding RAID volume. And because I somewhere lost (I'm storing all these pieces, but once a time I feel I have too much of small cables, screws etc. and I do the cleanup :)) the precise length SATA power and data cables I was screwed. The data cable is easy to buy, although the shortest one I was able to find in reasonably long time was 50cm length. Never mind, it will fit there, with or without using force.</p>

<p>The problem was the power cable. After some searching I realized that the connector on motherboard is actually same as was on floppy drives (did anybody seen floppy drive in last 5 years?). With this information it was little bit easier to find the cables and/or adapters. At the end I bought SATA power < -> molex, molex (M) < -> molex (F) + floppy adapter. It works nicely, and also fits the box.</p>

<p>Just wondering what I'll do, when floppies will be absolutely dead. Maybe I should buy couple of these cables in advance. :D</p>

<p>Hope this helps somebody when looking for this cable for Synology NAS (maybe the new products have also new more up-to-date connectors).</p>
