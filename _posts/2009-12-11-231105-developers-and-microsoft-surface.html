<p>What will happen when you put couple of developers during the conference in front of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Surface</a>? Yes first couple of minutes they will be trying to find a way to plug in keyboard and see what's inside and how to make it crash as fast as possible. We did the same on recent <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2009-12-06-231079-jak-jsme-jeli-na-ms-fest %}">MS Fest</a>. After discovering nothing cool and just rebooting it we tested hardware limits. Putting as much fingers as possible and available. After collecting roughly 60 fingers and Surface still nicely working, tracking all and showing all the info, we gave up and started playing with it. Sure, some highly technical and logical game :D:</p>

<p>Yep, in every developer there's a child (and in us maybe two) who wants to play.</p>
