I'll be speaking at [Dotnetos Conference 2021][1] October 4th - 6th.

<!-- excerpt -->

My session is "How I put .NET into Firebird database engine". Conference is online, so go check the website and register. Hope to "see" you there.

> Firebird is a database engine similar to MS SQL, Postgres, DB2 and others. Since version 3 it also allows writing plugins. I took this capability and put .NET into it. It allows you to write stored procedures, functions, ... in .NET and have all this code executed in the context (address space, transaction, ...) of database engine. In this session I'll describe what hurdles I had to overcome, how I did it and how I'm hunting best possible performance.
