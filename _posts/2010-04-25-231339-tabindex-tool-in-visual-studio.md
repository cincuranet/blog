I remember from old times that I was using some plug-in into [Delphi][1] IDE to set tab order by clicking on components in order you wanted the ordering to be. Today I was reviewing the tab ordering in [ID3 renamer][2] as somebody reported in forum it's wrong. I was scared doing all the work through [Properties window][3] in Visual Studio.

But it turned out, that Visual Studio has this tool in the box. You can find the description [here][4]. You'll simply select form, go to View > Tab Order and click on different controls to change the ordering. You see the numbers directly in designer and go through possible options by clicking.

Pretty nice, don't you think?
