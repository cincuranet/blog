<p>I noticed is that the documentation for some of <a href="{% post_url 2010-03-06-231298-ienumerablestring-result-for-some-methods-in-system-io %}">new IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; methods in System.IO I wrote before</a> is missing important parts. For example, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143316(v=VS.100).aspx">old method</a> has notes about <a href="{% post_url 2010-01-09-231149-directory-getfiles-moral %}">unstable sorting</a> and about the different behavior for patterns where the extension is exactly three characters long. But the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd383571(v=VS.100).aspx">new one</a> is missing these notes and these are quite important, in my opinion. I hope this is just because we're in RC stage and in RTM all will be ready. Else it could cause confusion when using new methods (until you find the string[] version (or this post ;))).</p>
