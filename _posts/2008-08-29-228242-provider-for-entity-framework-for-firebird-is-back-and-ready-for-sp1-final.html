<p>The final version of SP1 for VS2008 and .NET 3.5 is out for a while. And you may noticed, that there were some <a class="" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2008/08/12/entity-framework-rtm-breaking-changes.aspx" >changes</a> between SP1 beta and SP1 final. These changes are happily not huge as between EF Beta 3 and SP1 Beta 1. </p><p>So if you want to test new version of FirebirdClient working with SP1 check the <a class="" href="http://netprovider.cincura.net/" >weekly builds</a>.</p><p> </p>
