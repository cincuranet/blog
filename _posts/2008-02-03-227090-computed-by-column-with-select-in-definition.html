<p>Imagine, you want to create computed by column with select in definition (on Firebird, of course). I never needed this, and I thought, it's not possible (from some trivial tests). But Slavek Skopalik demonstrated me the opposite. There's a tricky part with braces (you have to be strict and keep syntax). So you have to write <code>... computed by ((select x from y ...)) ...</code>. Cool, isn't it? ;)</p><p> </p>
