<p>Just a small taste of Entity Framework using Firebird. Nothing else is working (and probably something is doing what it shouldn't). :-) Compiled right now.</p><p><img src="http://i.blog.cincura.net/227265.png" /></p><p>First steps are always problematic. But without help from these guys (from Microsoft): David Sceppa, Jaroslaw Kowalski and Mike Kaufman I wouldn't finish this "a little bit working stub". Thank you guys!</p><p>I hope to show you, Firebird and .NET fans, better working versions in a near future.</p><p> </p>
