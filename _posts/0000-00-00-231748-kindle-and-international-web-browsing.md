Maybe it's related to [new firmware][1], but today I noticed, that my Kindle no longer limits access to web only to selected sites ([wikipedia][2], [amazon][3], ...). I'm able to access any page I want (here in Czech Republic). [ID3 renamer][4]'s site works, this blog as well. I don't know whether it's written somewhere and I just missed it, but I do like it.
