<p>The <a class="" href="http://www.hk-software.net/firebird-conference.com/content/" >Firebird Conference in Hamburg</a> is gone. But there are some resources, that I'm finding in my notebook bag. This picture<br /><img src="{{ site.url }}/i/226725.jpg" /><br /><br />proves that time spent on lunch and between sessions can be productive a lot. :) We've discussed Firebird charsets and collations, common tasks about charset, problems with specific behavior in some countries etc. There're Japanese, Czech, German (and maybe more) characters/language elements. Underlined chars above three Japanese characters in circles is my name (surname as far as i remember) in Japanese characters. Nice, isn't it? :)</p>
