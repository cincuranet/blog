Maybe a bit late with Christmas gift. But better late than never, right? Also just before end of the year because what's a better plan than to update your production software last day of year. Go for it. :-P  

Anyway, new 4.6.0.0 version of [ADO.NET provider for Firebird][1] is ready for download.

<!-- excerpt -->

Overview of changes can be found in [tracker][4].

You can get the bits from NuGet [FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient][2] and [EntityFramework.Firebird][3] (or from [firebirdsql.org][1]).
