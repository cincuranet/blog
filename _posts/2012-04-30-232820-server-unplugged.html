<p>One of my first servers I used for real world applications is now unplugged. Weird feeling. It was Linux box running <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> 10.2.0 (yeah, old). For a while it was my main mail (<a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>, <a href="http://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a>) and antispam (<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a>) server. I had <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/">Firebird</a> there as well as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache/httpd</a>, <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion </a>and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>. And all the standard services (SSH, cron, FTP, gcc, ...). The Firebird handled quite some applications thorough years. Apache handled till very last time, among other things, download mirror for <a href="http://www.pspad.com/">PSPad</a> (and I learned a lot about performance tuning with limited resources available when new (non-beta) version of PSPad was released). Few scripts were written in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, a lot of in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/bash/">bash</a> directly. And that's just what I remember.</p>

<p>Upgrading, configuring, compiling all these services... What a great memories.</p>

<p>You served well all these years (8?).</p>
