Few days ago we <a href="{% post_url 2011-11-09-232561-entity-framework-help-on-twitter-aka-efhelp %}">started using <code>#efhelp</code> hashtag for Entity Framework related questions</a>. It's starting well so far, but there was one small problem. Without a support from client application you can't follow hashtag. That leaves you with the search "solution". 

To make it little bit more pleasant for people interested in <code>#efhelp</code>, I created a simple bot, that retweets everything with <code>#efhelp</code> under <a href="http://twitter.com/EFHelp">@EFHelp</a> account. Hence now you can follow this account to be in picture. (Posting to that account does nothing and it's not actively monitored.)
