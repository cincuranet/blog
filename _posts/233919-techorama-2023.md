[I'll be speaking at Techorama 2023][1] happening May 15-17. This year I'll have one session and one workshop. The session is _What's new in Entity Framework Core 7_. The [workshop][2] is _Mastering Entity Framework Core_.

<!-- excerpt -->

For the workshop you can read more about the workshop (and me) [here][2]. We'll cover topics like:

* Database and provider configuration
* Creating and configuring model
* Inheritance, table splitting, keyless entities, shadow properties, shared entitites, owned types, converters, comparers, ...
* Lazy loading, split queries, custom SQL queries
* Custom mapping and custom functions
* Change tracking, ID generation, transactions, concurrency, batching
* Services configuration and implementing your own

But this just a subset of topics. Depending on questions (and time), we can (and very likely will) steer one way or the other.

Hope to see you on my workshop or my session.
