<p>In March <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2009-03-10-229121-quick-search-and-call-hierarchy-in-vs-2010 %}">I wrote about one of the new features in Visual Studio</a>, time being called Quick Search. If you look into VS2010 Beta 2 (current latest) you may be confused as there's no function called like that. Now it's called Navigate To. Luckily the shortcut is untouched - Ctrl+,. So if you wanna give it a try, look for this new name (or use the good old shortcut).</p>
