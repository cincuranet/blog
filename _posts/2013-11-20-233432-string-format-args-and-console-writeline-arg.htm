<p>I never noticed it, but as I was today rewriting some <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/828t9b9h(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>Console.WriteLine</code></a>'s behavior I saw it clear. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/828t9b9h(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>Console.WriteLine</code></a> (in linked overload) takes <code>params</code> named <code>arg</code>. But the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b1csw23d(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>String.Format</code></a> takes <code>params</code> named <code>args</code>, as you would probably expect.</p>

<p>Wondering how that happened. :) Sure, it has almost zero impact on the code itself and changing it would be a breaking change (now with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd264739.aspx">named parameters</a> it's little bigger break), but we has bigger changes in even behavior during the years. Or maybe it's just to cosmetical. 8-)</p>
