Oh yeah. [.NET Developer Days 2022][1] is coming. Can't wait to be there. This year, I'll be doing workshop as well as sessions. Lucky me.

<!-- excerpt -->

Let's talk about the workshop. I called it [_Writing and measuring high performance code with latest .NET and C# features _][2]. And it's all about the features that C# and .NET brought us in last 5 or so years. And not only that, it's also about how you can actually correctly measure and observe your optimization (performance). Go check the [detailed description][2] and register. At the end of the day, we all will be happy to sit with a beer and cool our heads.

For the main conference two of my sessions were selected. First is _.NET 6 features that they didn't tell you about_, other is _Azure Spot instances as your secret weapon_.

> .NET 6 and related frameworks came with plethora of new big features. But there's also fair amount of small, but still very interesting, features, that you might even use more often than the big features. In this session I'll try to uncover these for you.

> Almost everyone knows virtual machines in Azure. But with a little effort, it is possible to modify the application and use Spot instances, which can be an interesting financial alternative. In this session we will look at what Spot instances are, how they differ from common VMs and how to use them effectively.

Hope you'll enjoy the conference (I know I will.) and let's have a chat.
