<p>Few minutes ago I got flash of intelligence. I'm using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.timer.aspx">Timer</a> in one of my windows service running simply 24&times;7. And I had a bug getting wrong data on server that I was not able to reproduce locally. Same data, same code, nothing. That was pretty weird, because after roughly four days I restarted the service and it started working correctly.</p>

<p>I opened a debugger, started the service locally and went for some candy. Because the data should be refreshed by default every two minutes, when I came back I realized, that the refresh procedure was not run, because there was a breakpoint, but no hit. So I started looking for some info in documentation, when suddenly the note followed by recalling the knowledge came in:</p>

<blockquote>As long as you are using a Timer, you must keep a reference to it. As with any managed object, a Timer is subject to garbage collection when there are no references to it. The fact that a Timer is still active does not prevent it from being collected.</blockquote>

<p>Yep, I was creating the instance but I was not holding a reference to it, so in under the refresh interval it was garbage collected. : Shame on me. But. We learn by mistakes.</p>
