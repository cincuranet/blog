After I [wrote the earlier piece][1], I realized there's maybe another option. And then after thinking about it I realized it's not that black and white either.

So you don't want to be bothered by work emails, IMs etc. during you vacation? And the plan is to go somewhere where the hotel has no Wi-Fi available. I think that's a great idea. Until it isn't. I don't know about you but I rely on some basic information from internet daily. Even on vacation. Checking weather is pretty simple once you're online, right? What about some maps? Sure it's not as good as dedicated hiking map especially if you're in i.e. mountains, but it's good to have a basic orientation. And the list goes on.

Don't take me wrong I like being on places where it's just me. I like being in mountains and running there. I know how to "survive" without "being connected". However it's just another tool in my tool belt. Same as i.e. compass (I mean the physical one, not the one in phone ;)).

Luckily last week when I was relying on hotel's Wi-Fi, it was not reliable and I had to log in after about 5 minutes of inactivity. And that was good. I was so bothered by logging in, I used it only when I really needed it. But still I could check the weather at least (which was unless anyway as the weather in French Alps was playing its own game).

Now back to work.
