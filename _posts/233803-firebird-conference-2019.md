After a small pause in every-year Firebird conferences, filled with few "seminars", the Firebird Conference is back. This year in Berlin, Germany. 

<!-- excerpt -->

I'll have 4 sessions, all related to .NET and Firebird. What else, right? Here's the list.

* What's new in .NET driver for Firebird
* Using Firebird with .NET Core and Entity Framework Core
* FbNetExternalEngine
* Comparing Firebird databases with FirebirdDbComparer

> Over the last few years and months, the .NET driver for Firebird was making a progress for more complete ADO.NET provider, with fewer bugs and more performance. In this session, I'll look at all the improvements and all the drivers (and possibilities) available.

> .NET Core runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS and so does Firebird. Why not take the advantage and create new applications on .NET Core, using Entity Framework Core, and as a storage use Firebird.

> Firebird 3 introduced plugins that allow you to execute any code and return some data back - triggers, stored procedures and functions to be precise. Similar to old UDFs, but as a plugin. The FbNetExternalEngine uses this and allows you to have a logic written in any .NET language, like C#, and use it as a function for example. So you have all the power of .NET ecosystem inside Firebird.

> Managing changes in database structures are difficult. Especially if you have multiple versions up in the air. FirebirdDbComparer is a new library that allows you to do the compares, trying to create the script as a sane person would do. Either you can use it as a library and use it from within your application or as a standalone executable.

Although the [conference][1] is close, you can still [register][1] and enjoy the content.
