<p>I have implemented new feature available from FB2.0, it's <a href="http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/DNET-165">timeout for wait transaction</a>. It's a nice feature, 'cause you can specify how long do you wanna wait before getting deadlock error. Thanks also to Dmitry Yemanov for debug (that also revealed couple of new bugs; now already fixed).</p>

<p>The current implementation is pretty straightforward. If you don't specify timeout then it's not used (which is important <a href="http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/DNET-193">for &lt;FB2.0</a>). Else (and you're using wait transactions) is used. :) With this I redesigned a little bit the options for transactions. Now it's more flexible and open for future improvements. Defining options for transaction is little bit different:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">conn.BeginTransaction(new FbTransactionOptions() { TransactionBehavior = FbTransactionBehavior.Wait, WaitTimeout = 3 }))</pre>
<p>Of course, you can create options object separately and put to method only variable. Changing old code to new one is just couple of rewriting, no new logic.</p>
