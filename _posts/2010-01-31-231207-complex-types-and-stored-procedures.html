<p>I like the idea of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb738472.aspx">complex type</a>. Sadly the designer didn't supported complex types in EFv1/VS2008, although you could use it manually editing the model (it's just a XML file). The designer in EFv2/VS2010 supports complex types (and you can use it also with EFv1, <a href="http://thedatafarm.com/blog/data-access/leveraging-vs2010-rsquo-s-designer-for-net-3-5-projects/">see this</a>) hence it's time to start really using these.</p>

<p>Unfortunately nothing is perfect. As far as you don't wanna map some stored procedure result to collection of entities, then the designer will tell you, that it's not supported. :( And Jeff Derstadt pointed in <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/adonetefx/thread/528d6d79-e8d8-4db7-86c9-0aa2d29dca08/">forum</a> that this limitation will not be solved in RTM.</p>

<p>I'm using EFv4 in my current project and thanks to ability to map functions directly to LINQ functions via <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.objects.dataclasses.edmfunctionattribute(VS.100).aspx">EdmFunction</a> attribute I was able to to a lot of work via functions and queries created by EF itself. But I always feel a little bug in my head saying "What if you'll need it later?". Sure I can redo all back into direct properties, but if it's close to the end of the project it's pretty expensive to do it.</p>

<p>What a pity, I see complex types as a good concept, but I'm too careful to close myself the path with SPs.</p>
