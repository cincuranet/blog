<p>If you're using Firebird from .NET you should visit my talk on <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/firebird-conference-2011/">Firebird Conference 2011</a>. This year it's in Luxembourg at November 25-26.</p>

<p>There's no schedule yet (in time of writing), but I can tell you, that my talk will be on Friday, for sure. Topics covered are obvious. Everything worth mentioning from last year or so in <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/net-provider/">.NET provider</a> development and also some future plans. Feel free to come and ask whatever .NET provider related (or Firebird) you want.</p> 

<p><i>P.S. Would you be interested in picking up some Twitter questions during the talk?</i></p>
