<p>Yesterday I was doing my <a href="http://www.x2develop.com/">parallel-threading-async-locking course</a> and at one time we discussed (unplanned) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">Thread Local Storage (TLS)</a> with one participant. To make a long story short they needed to know when processing of some item in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Threading.ThreadPool.aspx"><code>ThreadPool</code></a> completed. The default implementation of <code>ThreadPool</code> doesn't have such event, but luckily we can create such one. I sketched this in under five minutes and I think it might be worth for others.</p>

<p>It's just a proof of concept. But you can change it for you specific usage. If you dive deep (enough) you'll more or less end up with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.aspx"><code>Task</code></a> object. :)</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
class MyThreadPool
{
	public static event EventHandler OperationCompleted;

	public static void QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallback operation, object state)
	{
		ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(o =&gt;
			{
				try
				{
					operation(o);
				}
				finally
				{
					OnOperationCompleted();
				}
			}, state);
	}

	static void OnOperationCompleted()
	{
		if (OperationCompleted != null)
			OperationCompleted(null, EventArgs.Empty);
	}
}
</pre>
