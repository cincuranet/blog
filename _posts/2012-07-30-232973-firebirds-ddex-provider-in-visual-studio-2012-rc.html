<p>As with every new Visual Studio, I'm trying the <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/net-provider/">DDEX provider for Firebird</a> with it. The <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2008-11-22-228661-ddex-for-firebird-and-visual-studio-2010 %}">version 2010</a> was piece of cake. The VS 2012 (RC in time of writing) was little bit of trial and error. But I'm not a quitter! Anyway, the good news is, it works. No magic changes needed. Only some tweaking of registry file. Rest is same as in <a href="http://firebird.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/firebird/NETProvider/trunk/DataDesignerExtensibility/ReadMe.txt?view=markup">ReadMe.txt</a>. These will be available with next build (and of course in SVN) of provider, probably when VS 2012 RTM will be released.</p>

<p>Some images to turn you on. :)</p>
