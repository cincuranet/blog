<p>I almost forgot to announce the topics touching <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=files&id=netprovider">ADO.NET provider for Firebird</a>. This year I have three sessions. You can find more info, and register, of course, at <a href="http://www.firebird-conference.com">firebird-conference.com</a>. Here's the list.</p>

<ul>
	<li>New features in .NET provider for Firebird</li>
	<li>Connecting to Firebird using .NET provider from various devices - iPad, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone,...</li>
	<li>Creating services for rich internet applications using Firebird and the OData protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you're interested in any of these topic, come, ask, participate. Especially hearing scenarios in what you're using the .NET provider is very valuable for me. I also like talking between sessions, I always learn something new and I'm eager to to my best to answer all questions people are asking.</p>
