I know a lot of people asked me about .NET Core version of FirebirdClient. Unfortunately the Firebird 3 was released few months ago as well and so it was about priorities (and also my free time). Luckily recently I got some free time and also a reason and time to work on .NET Core port thanks to [Integrative][1].

Without further ado, here's the picture (worth a thousand words).

It's still pretty early and there's still some work to do. Also as I was going through the whole code base I've found some not-so-nice code and some inconsistencies, which I decided to fix as well. No reason to postpone, at this point (and also the non-Core version will benefit as well).

But I'm pretty stoked. I works now and it's about finishing the last 5% (the difficult part :)). I'm getting there.
