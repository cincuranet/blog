I'll be speaking at [Azure Community Conference 2021][1] that is going to happen in about 2 weeks. It's online, so you can easily attend.

<!-- excerpt -->

My session is called _Azure Storage (maybe) hidden features_.

> Azure Storage is a basic tool for storing your data in Azure. But it has more features than just simply that. In this session we'll check some, maybe hidden ones, that might become handy in some scenarios.
