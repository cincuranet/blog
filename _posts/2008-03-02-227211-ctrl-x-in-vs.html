<p>This week I've found neat "trick". When you have cursor on some line (nothing is selected) and you will press Ctrl-X whole line is cutted out (including newline char). With this I can easily remove line and/or paste whole line on another place (and because it includes newline char the adjacent line jumps away).</p><p> </p>
