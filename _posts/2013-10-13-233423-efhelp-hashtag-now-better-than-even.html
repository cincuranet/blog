<p>The <code>#efhelp</code> hashtag on Twitter is now back (not that it was ever off, just slightly crippled). The <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-11-11-232567-improved-efhelp-hashtag-cooperation-with-efhelp">original</a> implementation worked in a quick'n'dirty way. It fetched RSS feed for <code>#efhelp</code> search and pushed it through <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> to create a new feed (basically creating RT with link) and this one was re-published into <a href="https://twitter.com/efhelp">@EFHelp account</a> (motivation for this can be found there too).</p> 
<!-- excerpt --->
<p>This stopped working months ago as Twitter made all these feeds obsolete. I finally found a time and will to use the new Twitter API, well to find and use some library. I was not into creating new application in Twitter and all this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a> stuff. And of course where to run this. The new application is simply fetching all <code>#efhelp</code> tagged tweets and retweeting (real retweet, so it's easier to get into conversation with questioner) under @EFHelp. I'm checking the search few times per hour, so it's not instantenous, but should be quick enough. The application runs on a small box in my office, hence some downtime is possible.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy this new functionality. Also now with full Twitter API we can do whatever we want, just tell me. For example I'm thinking about retweeting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/entity-framework"><code>entity-framework</code> tag from StackOverflow</a>.</p>
