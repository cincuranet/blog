The DotFest conference, part of HardFest conferences, is going to happen 16-17 October online (which is little bit sad, because I'd like to visit Novosibirsk, from where the conference will be streamed) and I'll be [talking about _Using Roslyn to improve your codebase_][1]. Basically taking advantage of Roslyn's open design where you can use various pieces of the whole compiler platform and create your own tools with the full power of "compiler" i.e. sematic analysis.

You can register on the [site][2] and I hope to see you there.

> Roslyn is not a black box compiler, but not only has a lot of extension points, but also lot of pieces and places you can use to analyze and understand your code. Not only that, you can also parse and modify or generate code safely with it.
