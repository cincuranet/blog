<p>Generally, I'm not recommending services I'm using here. But experience from today is just too great not to share it. I'm using Hosted Exchange from <a href="http://www.sherweb.com/">Sherweb</a>.</p>

<p>Last week I ordered something from one e-shop and I didn't received the email neither the next one after phone urgency what is with my order. Today morning I jumped into support chat with Sherweb and we found that emails has been blocked because of the sending mailserver was on two blacklists. Yep, I thought it'll something like that. But the people from Sherweb were able not only to found the reason, but also find the emails and manually redeliver(!!!) these after a week(!!!).</p>

<p>Wow. I can't be more pleased with the attitude (and steps they're able to do - in most setups I've seen, the rejected email is after bouncing the mail (if used) deleted) of Sherweb. The Hosted Exchange service provided is simply great, great service!</p>
