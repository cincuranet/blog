If you're looking for a help related to [Entity Framework][1] and you're on Twitter (mine is [@cincura_net][2]) you can try asking with hashtag [`#efhelp`][3]. Sure, no promises about getting reply, but this hashtag is monitored with a lot of skilled people. If it not fits into 140 characters, you might also find somebody willing to help you using different channel (i.e. email, [StackOverflow][4], on-site, ...).
