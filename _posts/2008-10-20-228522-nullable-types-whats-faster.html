<p>Today I was working with nullable types - <code>short?</code> for my instance. I was wondering what's the fastest way of getting value and also testing whether the value is there.</p>
<p>1. <code>HasValue</code> vs. <code>!= null</code><br />Well test on my notebook on .NET FW 3.5 in VPC, optimization turned on shows that HasValue is faster. Roughly twice on my configuration. Also the IL code looks different.</p>
<p>2. Using <code>Foo.Value</code> vs. <code>(short)Foo</code><br />Here I didn't measured any difference. And the code is pretty much same. It's not exhaustive testing (and you know - I believe only in stats I adulterated ;)).</p>
<p>I did about 10 runs for each test and looked to IL (it's fastest way to prove your idea is wrong or not). </p>
<p>What about you? Similar results?</p>
