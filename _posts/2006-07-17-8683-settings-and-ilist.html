<p>Today I needed to save to configuration <font face="Courier New">IList&lt;string&gt;</font>. I tried the browse dialog of settings tab (the "dialog" when you double-click on settings file, I have no idea whether it has any special name). But what was the surprise, when I was unable to add item with this type. I was traversing dialogs and trying to hack it to allow me add <font face="Courier New">System.Collections.Generics.IList&lt;string&gt;</font>. </p><p>But the solution was really easy. I've just edited the files by hand and everything was OK. So my advice is not to trying convince the type selection dialog, but take the bit in one's teeth - quick&amp;dirty. :)</p>
