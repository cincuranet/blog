<p>Today I decided to move <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2013-06-03-233311-edmgen2-for-net-4-5-and-entity-framework-5 %}">updated EdmGen2</a> sources from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> to <a href="https://github.com/cincuranet/EdmGen2">GitHub</a>. I'm still absolutely happy with BitBucket for my private projects, but for OSS GitHub is de facto standard and EdmGen2 might be more visible there.</p>

<p>Feel free to contribute, issue pull requests, ...</p>
