<p>Few months ago <a href="http://twitter.com/migueldeicaza">Miguel de Icaza</a> posted on Twitter message about explicitly stating your member private access modifier (or anything that's default) and that he doesn't understand it, the he wants his code be succinct.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
class Foo
{
	private int _bar;
	// or?
	int _bar;
}
</pre>

<p>I, as a lot of other people, replied, that I want to be explicit about my code. Tell exactly what I want. However I had a sneaking idea in my brain since this message - because I like my code, my thoughts in code, to be succinct - and I decided give it a try. I removed all the explicit access modifiers that are actually default from <a href="http://www.id3renamer.com">ID3 renamer</a>'s code base a start. Well, after working with it some time, I didn't noticed anything confusing. There's only couple of default rules, so it's not like you would need to learn a lot of new stuff. And, for me, because there's less text in source code, it looks more readable for me, especially if I'm just checking something out using notepad-like (no highlighting) viewer.</p> 

<p>I'm now following this "rule" for every new code I'm writing. I like it when I spin my head around something that looks completely useless to think about, for a first sight, but later shows up to be a good idea or true.</p>
