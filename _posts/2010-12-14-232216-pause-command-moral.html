<p>Few days ago I created batch file to backup <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird</a> databases, <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> repositories and some other data on a new server. During the testing of the script I put <code>PAUSE</code> command at the end, to see the result (or better to say errors). After I was done with polishing it up I created record in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383614.aspx">Task Scheduler</a> and started test run. Everything finished in a couple of minutes nicely. I left it there, expecting it to do the backup during the night, as scheduled.</p>

<p>Next day I checked the result and the task failed with <code>0x8004131F</code> aka <code>SCHED_E_ALREADY_RUNNING</code>. I checked CPU and disk utilization and it was clear the backup is not running. Kind of confused I ran backup manually and waited another day. And guess what, same error. As you probably now see, the problem was the <code>PAUSE</code> command at the end of the script. So the task was actually running, and waiting for the input. Clearly visible in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653">Process Explorer</a>.</p>

<p>I removed it and now everything works fine. Such a stupid mistake caused such a confusion. :)</p>
