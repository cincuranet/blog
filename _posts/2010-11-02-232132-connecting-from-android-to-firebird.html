<p>Remember the <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2010-01-23-231195-connecting-from-iphone-to-firebird %}">challenge I did</a> some time ago with <a href="http://firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=files&id=netprovider">.NET provider for Firebird</a> and <a href="http://monotouch.net/">MonoTouch</a>? Well because I've got access to previews of <a href="http://monodroid.net/">MonoDroid</a>, why not to try the same here?</p>

<p>Again it's a pretty challenge for the whole MonoDroid stack, as the provider uses a lot of various pieces from .NET Framework. And taking into account, the MonoDroid is still in previews phase I wasn't sure I'll be able to succeed. However I did. With some tweaking, and I kind of remembered the important places from <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2010-01-23-231195-connecting-from-iphone-to-firebird %}">last attempt</a>, so it was faster, I was able to make it work easily.</p>

<p>Cool, isn't it? Taking into account, that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone_7">Windows Phone 7</a> (because everything there is based on <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>) doesn't contain pieces from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa286484.aspx">ADO.NET</a>, it's nice that <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> isn't crippling the objects available.</p>

<p>Still using i.e. OData is probably better idea, but who knows what somebody might wanna create.</p>
