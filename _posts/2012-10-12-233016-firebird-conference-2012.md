The [Firebird Conference 2012][1] is again going to happen in Luxembourg during October 26-27, 2012. And I'll be there. So if you have some questions about .NET provider for Firebird catch me.

And I'll also have two sessions:

1. What's new in ADO.NET provider for Firebird
2. Getting started with Firebird from .NET with ADO.NET provider for Firebird

And I have some interesting stuff in my bag. I think you'll like it. Either visit my sessions or wait after it's over. ;)

See you there.
