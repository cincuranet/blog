<p>If you're looking for a help related to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx">Entity Framework</a> and you're on Twitter (mine is <a href="http://twitter.com/cincura_net">@cincura_net</a>) you can try asking with hashtag <code><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23efhelp">#efhelp</a></code>. Sure, no promises about getting reply, but this hashtag is monitored with a lot of skilled people. If it not fits into 140 characters, you might also find somebody willing to help you using different channel (i.e. email, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/entity-framework">StackOverflow</a>, on-site, ...).</p>
