<p>We use (at least I do) our phones as daily notebooks of what's going on and what needs to be done. But there's one thing in particular that I don't understand.</p>

<p>Let me start like this. I keep track of what needs to be done using tasks. Tasks using Outlook and Exchange. Together with appointments and emails this keeps me fully informed even when my laptop isn't available.</p>

<p>What worries me is the absence of tasks in todays phones and the synchronization as first class citizens. Neither iPhone or Android or Windows Phone 7 support tasks out of the box. Not talking about integrating it with calendar views.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question: "What are you using as tasks or are tasks obsolete?".</p>
