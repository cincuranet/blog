I'm running [Synology][1] DS207+ home. I know this one is old, but it still works fine. And it does almost all I need. From time to time I change hard drives because the old one are basically done. Luckily the [RAID 1][2] saves me a lot of trouble.

<!-- excerpt -->

Because the box is outdated I'm always a bit nervous with new drives. Of course I buy bigger ones and there's a chance of these not working. Not being able to use full capacity is bad but not critical. Nothing working is scary. Recently I bought 2TB Western Digital drives, [WD20EFRX][3]-68EUZN0 to be precise. Put these in and it worked like a charm. It worked and I see full capacity. Yay.

I suppose it should work also with newer, though still outdated, models like x08 etc.

Hope it helps.
