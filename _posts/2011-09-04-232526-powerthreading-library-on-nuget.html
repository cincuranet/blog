<p>I like <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet</a> because it removes the hassle of downloading and installing libraries. And sadly only small number of vendors is providing just package without installer. And I also like parallel/multithreaded programming. Crucial tool in my toolbox for parallel programming is Jeffrey Richter's (<a href="http://wintellect.com/">Wintellect</a>) <a href="http://wintellect.com/powerthreading.aspx">PowerThreading</a> library. The library is great and contains a lot of smart ideas <a href="#anchor1">[1]</a> and some handy objects too. And it's completely <i>free</i>.</p>

<p>Sadly it was not on NuGet. Hence I took the challenge and <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/PowerThreading">created the package</a>. It's called simply <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/PowerThreading">PowerThreading</a>. Don't take me wrong, Jeffrey is doing great job with this library and I'm and will be happy to maintain the package. He's too smart to waste his time on this; spending rather the time on improving it, is more valuable.</p>
