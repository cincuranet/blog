It has been few exciting weeks and days lately and today I'm happy to introduce you to [_FbNetExternalEngine_][1] version 2.0. This version adds support for functions and also improves performance (on top of [previous improvements][2]).

<!-- excerpt -->

Let's start with functions. It's pretty simple. You have a static function that accepts and returns one of the supported types (see [docs][1]) and you can then declare in the database using the `external name` and `engine` clauses. Usage is as with any other function. Comparing the performance, empty function invocation takes about 2,6 Î¼s on my machine and is about 2,6 times slower compared to PSQL. Obviously once the function actually does something the performance against PSQL starts improving.

Speaking about performance. I have spent quite some time in various tools looking for ways to improve. And it was always humbling - when I thought I can't find a way to make that part of code faster, I always found a way later and it was not even so much hacking and so on. Both functions and procedures benefit from any improvement, because there's a lot code shared across both paths. To give you some numbers, compared to previous release, the procedures are about 10-15% faster. And I'm not done. I have already few ideas how to improve even more, if it works. Can't wait to try it out (but I also wanted to release the functions support).

Documentation, examples and performance numbers are available on [this page][1].

Last but not least big thanks to [SMS-Timing][3] for sponsoring my work on the plugin.
