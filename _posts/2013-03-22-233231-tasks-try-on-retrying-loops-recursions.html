My mind today was in weird shape (again). I blame Friday. What that means is, that I came with weird pieces of code, that are fun to just write. Brain training. :)

The set up was simple. I had a <code><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.aspx">Task</a></code> that was returning <code>bool</code>; <code>true</code> if succeeded, <code>false</code> otherwise. Because the code was interacting with 3<sup>rd</sup> party system it was desired to retry if the call didn't succeeded. 

Looking at it in front of me I realized I'll be probably able to (ab)use the <code><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.continuewith.aspx">ContinueWith</a></code> method and recursion. When I wrote it I realized there's a room for refactoring. And then I realized I might create and extension method from it. Already half way in hell. :)

<pre class="brush:csharp">
public static Task&lt;TResult&gt; Retry&lt;TResult&gt;(this Func&lt;Task&lt;TResult&gt;&gt; taskMethod, Func&lt;TResult, bool&gt; resultOK, int retries)
{
	return taskMethod()
		.ContinueWith(t =&gt;
			retries == 0 || resultOK(t.Result)
				? Task.FromResult(t.Result)
				: Retry(taskMethod, resultOK, --retries))
		.Unwrap();
}
</pre>

Umm, how it will look like with <code>await</code>, I thought. Then I can use loop.
 
<pre class="brush:csharp">
public static async Task&lt;TResult&gt; Retry2&lt;TResult&gt;(this Func&lt;Task&lt;TResult&gt;&gt; taskMethod, Func&lt;TResult, bool&gt; resultOK, int retries)
{
	while (true)
	{
		var result = await taskMethod();
		if (retries-- == 0 || resultOK(result))
			return result;
	}
}
</pre>

This doesn't look nice. I thought it will be smoother. This is like 90s. Back to recursion.

<pre class="brush:csharp">
public static async Task&lt;TResult&gt; Retry3&lt;TResult&gt;(this Func&lt;Task&lt;TResult&gt;&gt; taskMethod, Func&lt;TResult, bool&gt; resultOK, int retries)
{
	var result = await taskMethod();
	return retries == 0 || resultOK(result)
		? result
		: await Retry3(taskMethod, resultOK, --retries);
}
</pre>

That looks better. I don't know whether I like the first or the third version more. But. What about performance? The second version has least code to execute. No doubt. The third version has two <code>await</code>s and the recursion (nesting) with <code>await</code>s. This is probably not going to be good for performance. And my tests confirms that. Slightly slower than second is the first version. Thus the winner for me is version #1. 8-)

I'm not sure why I did this (from practical perspective), but it was fun. Have a great Friday.
