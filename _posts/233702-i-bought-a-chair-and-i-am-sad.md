I'm sad. I'm sad because I bought myself a chair. It sounds probably confusing, why buying yourself a chair would make you sad. Stay with me.

<!-- excerpt -->

About 5 years ago I transitioned to using standing desk. I recommend reading [my blog post about the transition][1] to understand my motivation and so on. Unfortunately, thorough last year, year and a half I was struggling with standing. I was not using chair at all. I didn't even have one. But more and more the standing was tiring. During my evening runs my legs were often "heavy". I wasn't happy working in afternoons because my heels were sore. Thus, yesterday I did overcome my pride, drove to the city, tested few chairs and brought one home.

And why sad? I always had (and kind of still have) the feeling that standing was good, if you were healthy and fit. Even though smart people said neither standing nor siting is good and you should vary how you work. And getting back to chair feels like admitting I'm old(er), not healthy and as fit as I was (Let's face it, I _am_ less fit now, my running mileage is less than it was before, which is frustrating as well.). I suppose I can't deny my age now reads 5 more years. And I'm not in the same spot as I was 5 years ago.

I have to confront the struggle. This post was written completely while sitting.
