Almost exactly a year ago I was sitting in a restaurant after _Update Days: Corestart 3.0_ conference with my _‚Üπ over ‚ê£ ‚ê£ ‚ê£_ shirt facing [Olia Gavrysh][4], Program Manager at .NET team in Microsoft. And she mentioned how she liked the shirt (and that [Immo Landwerth][5], another Program Manager in .NET team would like it too (maybe that was a sarcasm)) and that I should make the shirt available for buying. 

<!-- excerpt -->

That struck me, because I though the _tabs over spaces_ was just my funny thing and nobody would be interested in buying such product. But it stuck in my head. It wasn't a bad idea. A small batch could be, in worst case, just a supply for me. But I didn't want a shirt. Shirts are dumb. I wanted something that I personally would like and find useful. Fast forward about two months back and I found it - tubular headband or scarf or buff (whatever you want to call it and use it as). The buff (I call it buff, because I became aware of such product years ago thanks to my ultrarunning thing and [BUFF][1] company/products) is my favourite "extra" piece of gear for running (or doing any activity for that matter).

Here it is. And as a first step into this world, I'm happy about the result. 

[![‚Üπ over ‚ê£ ‚ê£ ‚ê£ buff]({{ include "post_ilink" page "buff1_thumb.jpg" }})]({{ include "post_ilink" page "buff1.jpg" }})

[![‚Üπ over ‚ê£ ‚ê£ ‚ê£ buff]({{ include "post_ilink" page "buff2_thumb.jpg" }})]({{ include "post_ilink" page "buff2.jpg" }})

[![‚Üπ over ‚ê£ ‚ê£ ‚ê£ buff]({{ include "post_ilink" page "buff3_thumb.jpg" }})]({{ include "post_ilink" page "buff3.jpg" }})

The buff is very light gray and the text is black and dark gray, basically same text as here in the header. Nothing else is there, I wanted to keep it clean and not "branded".

If you'd like to have one - and seriously, who wouldn't 8-) -, send me an [email][2] (or [tweet][2]) with your address and I'll get back to you. I have an initial batch of 50 and I'll be giving these for free. But if you'd like to pay for one (or more), you can and I decided I'll donate all the money to [UNICEF][3].

Now let's hope I'll run out quickly (and if that happens, I promise I'll create proper order page :-)). Olia already has one and I took one too. That means I have only 48 to sell...
