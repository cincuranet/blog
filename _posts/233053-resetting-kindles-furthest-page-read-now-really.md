About a year ago [I wrote about my solution to keep yourself in sync if you're reading some book once more][1]. The root cause of the problem was inability to reset the "furthest page read" marker easily. Today I was checking something in my _Your Kindle Library_ section of my Amazon's account and found this:

![image]({{ include "post_ilink" page "reset_fpr.png" }})

Yes. Now we have a way to clear the marker and start from fresh. Pretty nice.
