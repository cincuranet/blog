Why is there so much of talking about new Windows 10 Windows Updates installation procedure? My RSS reader is full of articles about it. You can't turn it off. And who cares? Not mentioning you can turn it off, it just takes more effort. 

Except some really special cases, which really doesn't matter for 99,999% users (yes, even developers), it is just common sense. Or at least I think. You need to have an up-to-date system. I implemented same rule in my home network. Every computer, except few (explained below), installs updates automatically.

<!-- excerpt -->

The only problem I have with it is the lack of smartness. Let me explain. The updates are installed by default sometime in the night. The problem is, I'm leaving often apps opened over the night to be able to continue where I left off. After the installation the system is (often) restarted. Clean desktop. That's why I have it turned off on few machines and I execute the installation manually. And I also often postpone, because I'm lazy to restore all the windows etc. - see, that's why I think "install and no (easy) exception" is a good choice.

Or do you see any good reason to not have this behavior (in general)?
