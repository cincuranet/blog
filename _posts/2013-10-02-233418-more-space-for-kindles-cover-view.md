When I bought ([link][1], [link][2]) the Kindle 5 Paperwhite the _Cover View_ was one part of the new UI. And I found it not that much usable. Basically half of the space was occupied with _Recommended Content_. Though the recommendations are often a good match (say hello to data-mining) it was just using a lot of space. So I - as I wrote in posts linked above - stoped using this view and used the old view with just text and lines.

But yesterday I was aimlessly jumping in Kindle's menus to kill some time because I was not in a mood to read yet. And I found something. In _Settings_ - _Device Options_ - _Personalize your Kindle_ there's a switch _Recommended Content_. Voil√†. Turned that off and the whole screen is now occupied with book covers. Well hidden.

Still don't know whether I like the _Cover View_ more, but it's for sure more usable now. What view are you using?
