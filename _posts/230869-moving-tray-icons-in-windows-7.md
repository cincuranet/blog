Today I found interesting thing. Tray icons in Windows 7 keep their position and you can reorder them in a way you want. What a great idea.

Because I like all tray icons to be visible, I can now place the most used closer to language bar and the other (in my case the informative) to the corner. Now as all my favorite apps have fixed place on taskbar (like it too) I can enjoy the same comfort with tray icons.
