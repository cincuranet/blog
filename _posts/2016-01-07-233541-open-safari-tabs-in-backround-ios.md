When I'm browsing on my phone I either click on a link and open it in current tab or I want to open to it in background tab. There's maybe .1% occurrence when I don't want background tab. And ever since I remember tabs on iOS in Safari it was foreground tab. And I thought it's given.

Mostly because the menu showed this.

You know. It says "new tab". There's no hint of background or foreground. And I lived with the pain. Until recently. I was looking for something, I don't even remember what, in Settings. And there I saw it. Settings > Safari > Open Links.

Eureka. I immediately changed it to "In Background" and my life improved instantly. I just wish I found it earlier.
