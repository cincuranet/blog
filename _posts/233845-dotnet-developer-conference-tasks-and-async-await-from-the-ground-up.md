Next week the .NET Developer Conference is happening. As an online event obviously. And I'll deliver half-day workshop there. The topic is _Tasks and async/await from the ground up_.

<!-- excerpt -->

More information about the workshop is available [here][2] and you can register [here][1]. I have prepared densely packed 4 hours. You'll learn a lot.

> What's all the fuss about async and await. Should I care? What's the motivation. What's basics. How to start correctly. All this and even more I'll explain in this session.

On a personal note, I hope in the future the conference will happen as an in-person event, because over last 5 or 6 years I flew to and from KÃ¶ln Bonn airport numerous times for work (focused workdays (and some running) inside nature in Nationalpark Eifel). And I and my boss, who was usually picking me up, developed optimization strategy consisting of me taking shortest path to the predefined door (near the corner), him driving by, and me almost jumping into the moving car (that's why the door was near the corner). And same way on return trip. Great memories. :)
