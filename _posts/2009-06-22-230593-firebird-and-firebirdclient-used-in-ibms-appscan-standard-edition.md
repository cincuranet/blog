Few days ago I got interesing information that IBM in [AppScan Standard Edition][1] is using [Firebird][2] database and [FirebirdClient][3] as .NET provider. It's a great finding where all is Firebird used.

_Do you have any interesting usage of Firebird and/or FirebirdClient? Let [us][4] (or [me][5]) know._
