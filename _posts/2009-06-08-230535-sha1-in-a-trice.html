<p>Having girls/womans in a dev team is always fun. Yes, you have to wash your body more than every Visual Studio release. :) But girls have also different way of looking at the problem. I had this experience in a <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2009-06-08-230533-rota-n-hyperboloid-ale-kdepak %}">training last week</a>. There's one girl in dev team. While showing how to work with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.aspx">Cryptography namespace</a> I was creating simple method for SHA1 hash. Saying, that's pretty easy to create SHA1 hash in a couple of lines I got a question (yes, from the girl ;)), whether it's possible to do it in one row, to make code more compact and show that's double pretty easy. And it really is:</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">
label1.Text = string.Join(string.Empty, new SHA1Managed().ComputeHash(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(textBox1.Text)).Select(_ =&gt; _.ToString()).ToArray());
</pre>
<p>It's not the most readable code, but as a helper function somewhere ... :)</p>
