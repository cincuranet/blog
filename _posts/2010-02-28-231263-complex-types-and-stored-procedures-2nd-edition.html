<p>Some time ago I was <a href="{% post_url 2010-01-31-231207-complex-types-and-stored-procedures %}">writing about not supported scenario when you have entity with complex type and you want to map result of stored procedure to this entity</a>. I couldn't believe that this, from my point of view fairly common, scenario will not be supported in designer in RTM.</p> 

<p>Right now I'm running RC of Visual Studio 2010 (the development probably in feature freeze mode) and the limitation is still there. :( Jeff Derstadt was absolutely right, unfortunately. Although Zeeshan Hirani in <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/adonetefx/thread/528d6d79-e8d8-4db7-86c9-0aa2d29dca08/">forum</a> said, he was able to do it manually, it's uncomfortable. Same as complex types in EFv1.</p>

<p>Looks like complex types, sadly, are still not first class citizens for designer.</p>
