[I'll be speaking at Techorama 2022][1] happening May 23-25. And Iâ€™m very excited about it. Over the last decade or so I was working with/for Belgium based company on and off, so Belgium has somewhat special place in my heart.

Two of my sessions were selected. First is _C# Source Generators - let the machine do the programming_ and other is _Performance with Span<T> for dummies (should I care?)_.

<!-- excerpt -->

> Source Generators are one of longest requested features in C# language. What is a source generator? What I can use it for? Also what I can't use it for? Answers to these and more in this session.

> Span<T>, although not exactly brand new, is still new kind on the block. In this session I'll show you what the Span<T> (and Memory<T>) is, how it works and the concepts behind. All explained using plain simple C# constructs.
