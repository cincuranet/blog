<p>OK, following log4net's versioning scheme <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-12-21-232619-log4net-back-alive-on-nuget %}">in NuGet package</a> wasn't a good idea. In version 1.2.11 the new keys were used and I used this as a fresh start. I didn't realized that thanks to <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> everybody will be updated to latest version and dependencies will be broken. My fault. :-?</p>

<p>If you read my <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-12-21-232619-log4net-back-alive-on-nuget %}">previous log4net post</a> there's a solution with modifying <code>package.config</code> file, but... So to fix it package owners were forced to repack the dependencies to be <code>=</code>. Not good.</p>

<p>So today I pushed version 2.0.0, which is actually 1.2.11 with new keys, and 1.2.11 was removed. So there's now on <a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a> the new <i>major</i> version and dependencies need to be explicitly stated to be compatible with it (again, it's 1.2.11 with new keys).</p>

<p>Fire is quenched, hopefully.</p>
