<p>I don't remember when people started begging <a href="http://entityframework.codeplex.com">EF team</a> to add support for reordering properties in EDMX designer. I think I first found the need around 2008. :) I hoped, guessing it's a simple feature, to have it in some update to EF1. Sadly not. Only option, though simple, was to open the EDMX as a XML file and change the order of properties in CSDL part.</p>

<p>Until now. Yes it took few years, few major Entity Framework versions, but it's finally there. But you might not know, as I didn't. Until we found it this week while I was teaching my <a href="http://www.x2develop.com">Entity Framework course</a>. If you install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40762">Entity Framework 6.1 tooling</a> you will get the new consolidated (Code First together with EDMX) tools/designer and some features previously available in EF Power Tools. When I installed it, I tried to reorder the properties using mouse and it didn't worked. So I concluded it's still ;) not there.</p> 

<p>But then we found it. You have to actually right click on a property and then there's a menu to move it up or down (and also bigger steps). It even works with keyboard - <code>Alt+Up</code> or <code>Alt+Down</code> respectively, for the start. Nice! I'm more keyboard/console guy so I don't mind missing "mouse support" (although I can imagine some people will find the current implementation incomplete).</p> 

<p>There you have it. If you're not actually reading the menus carefully and just clicking on familiar words as I do you might have missed it.</p>
