The new Visual Studio 2010 looks. I'm more interested in .NET FW 4.0 and C# 4 new features, but [some of the new stuff][1] makes me happy to. But one new function makes me crazy. The editor tabs has now the closing button on each tab. Similar to what browsers have. But I'm used to look at it in upper right corner. And every time I'm about to close a file using a mouse, I'm starting to move wrong way. I hope to get used to this new feature or have some option to turn on the old behavior.
