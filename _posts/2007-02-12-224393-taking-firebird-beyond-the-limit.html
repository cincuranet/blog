<font size=2><p>Well, a little bit weird heading. But a few days ago there was a really interesting discuss on the Firebird(CZ) list (about the ROW_COUNT variable). During the discussion I've decided (with Ivan Prenosil's kick) to test what will happen if you'll have more than 2G and also 4G records.</p><p>The 2G limit you overrun in a while. Nothing interesting happened. Of course functions working with Integer as result stopped working correctly.</p><p>More fun we expected (especially Ivan :)) after overruning the 4G limit. And ... nothing. Server worked like a charm, no errors, everything OK.</p><p>With some free space on disc we let the working and we stopped with 158GB database. Total count of records was really huge - 5 604 000 000. The last test was creating another table and insert some records and then pump for a while the â€žbig" table (to test whether the server not overwriting some data in other table (I know it's not perfect test). Negative. Everything worked correctly.</p><p>Now I/we can say that Firebird is able to handle 5 604 000 000 records.</p></font>
