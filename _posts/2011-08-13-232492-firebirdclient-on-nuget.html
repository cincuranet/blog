<p>Yep, it's done. Now you can download <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/net-provider/">FirebirdClient</a> from <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet</a>. From <a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient">nuget.org/List/Packages/FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient</a> to be precise.</p>

<p>It took me a while to find some time to create the package and publish it. But recently I started using NuGet quite often, so assigned this task higher priority.</p>

<p>The build there is same as the default one (targets .NET 4 CLR) you can download from site. Later I'd like to incorporate into package other versions (different CLRs, <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> builds, ...) too. Maybe the other pieces like WebProviders, DDEX (?) and unstable builds could be there too. I'll think about it more.</p>

<p>Hope you're excited as I'm and you'll enjoy it. :)</p>
