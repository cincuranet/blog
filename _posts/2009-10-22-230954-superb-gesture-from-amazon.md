Few days ago I bought [Amazon Kindle][1], the international version, as I'm not U.S.. The international version <del>is</del> was +$20 to the U.S. only version. And today I got email from Amazon saying that the price has been lowered to U.S. only price and that I'm getting my $20 back. 8)

> Good news! Due to strong customer demand for our newest Kindle with U.S. and international wireless, we are consolidating our family of 6" Kindles. As part of this consolidation, we are lowering the price of the Kindle you just purchased from $279 down to $259. You don't need to do anything to get the lower price--we are automatically issuing you a $20 refund. This refund should be processed in the next few days and will appear as a credit on your next billing statement.

That's a really nice gesture! Kudos to Amazon.

_I'll post my first experience tomorrow, when it will be finally delivered._
