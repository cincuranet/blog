If you're using Firebird from .NET you should visit my talk on [Firebird Conference 2011][1]. This year it's in Luxembourg at November 25-26.

There's no schedule yet (in time of writing), but I can tell you, that my talk will be on Friday, for sure. Topics covered are obvious. Everything worth mentioning from last year or so in [.NET provider][2] development and also some future plans. Feel free to come and ask whatever .NET provider related (or Firebird) you want.

_Would you be interested in picking up some Twitter questions during the talk?_
