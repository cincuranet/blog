I was writing some return type from function when I got <del>brilliant</del> dumb idea to start playing with braces, question marks etc. :) And I came with some self-competition to write a lot of different characters into a valid type definition (in C#, of course). _And simple repeating doesn't count._ But why not to create this as a public competition. ;) 

With the short first try I ended up with this:

```csharp
IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<int, int?>?[,]>
```

That's probably not the best what can be done. Do you have better idea? OK, it's your turn. Use comments. The best - I'm the referee - will get the lolipop.
