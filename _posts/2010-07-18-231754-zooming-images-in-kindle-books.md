Recently I was reading book with images at the end and I more or less accidentally pressed the 5-way joystick and got cursor near the image. What a surprise (for me; it's probably described in manual ;)):

There's a small magnifier icon and you can zoom in the image and see it full screen even if in book is only shown as small (of course, the book has to contain bigger image to see more details). In 16 shades of gray it's not perfect for pictures but better than nothing.
