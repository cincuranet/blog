<p>Today, while just randomly walking thru MSDN documentation I found new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.countdownevent(VS.100).aspx" >CountdownEvent class</a>. It's nothing ultra special. You can write similar class yourself in a couple of hours. But it's great that you don't have to. And with all the new stuff, like Task object, writing the multi-threaded apps is more easier than before (but sometimes it's neat to just write some algorithm/problem using only thread and critical sections).</p>
