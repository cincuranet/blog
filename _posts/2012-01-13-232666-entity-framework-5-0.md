I'm a little bit perplexed. [Entity Framework 4.3 Beta 1][2] was just released. And there's a sentence in the document that's very interesting:

> As soon as the next preview of the .NET Framework 4.5 is available we will be shipping EF 5.0 Beta 1, which will include all these new features.

Does it mean that the version that will ship with .NET Framework 4.5 (the next version in time of writing this post) is going to be _5.0_? I still clearly recall the mess the _second_ version with version number _4.0_ created - a lot of people, on my trainings, talks, ..., confused. What happened to clear [versioning strategy][3]?

I hope it's just a small miss/typo and the version will be Entity Framework 4.5 and the following (additive) updates will be 4.5+n.
