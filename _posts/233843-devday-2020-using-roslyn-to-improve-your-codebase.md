I have to say, Belgium has a special place in my heart, so when my session for DevDay.be was accepted, I was happy. I would be happier if the conference would be in-person, but 2020 is what it is. Anyway. I'll be [talking about _Using Roslyn to improve your codebase_][1]. Basically taking advantage of Roslyn's open design where you can use various pieces of the whole compiler platform and create your own tools with the full power of "compiler" i.e. sematic analysis.

<!-- excerpt -->

You can register on the [site][2] and I hope to see you in the chat room. If you're Dutch speaking, I promise, I'll sneak in at least one Dutch word into the session (although my vocalbulary is very very very limited) ;). 

> Roslyn is not a black box compiler, but not only has a lot of extension points, but also lot of pieces and places you can use to analyze and understand your code. Not only that, you can also parse and modify or generate code safely with it.
