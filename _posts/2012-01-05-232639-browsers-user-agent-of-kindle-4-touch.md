The [Kindle 4 Touch][1] has, as expected, new (improved) browser experience. It's pretty good in fact, for quick look and read on some pages or for reading articles in your [Instapaper][2].

If you're a site owner, you may want to know accesses from Kindle to your site (i.e. to provide simplified version). The `User-Agent` for Kindle 4 Touch with latest firmware (in time of writing this post - `Kindle 5.0.0 (1370280073)`) is:

```text
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux armv7l like Android; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.2+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0 Safari/533.2+ Kindle/3.0+
```

Probably the interesting piece is `Kindle/3.0+`, so you can distinguish previous [Kindle 3][3].
