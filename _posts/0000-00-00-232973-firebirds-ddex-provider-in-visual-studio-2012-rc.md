As with every new Visual Studio, I'm trying the [DDEX provider for Firebird][1] with it. The [version 2010][2] was piece of cake. The VS 2012 (RC in time of writing) was little bit of trial and error. But I'm not a quitter! Anyway, the good news is, it works. No magic changes needed. Only some tweaking of registry file. Rest is same as in [ReadMe.txt][3]. These will be available with next build (and of course in SVN) of provider, probably when VS 2012 RTM will be released.

Some images to turn you on. :)
