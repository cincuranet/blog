<p>I'm a little bit perplexed. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2012/01/12/ef-4-3-beta-1-released.aspx">Entity Framework 4.3 Beta 1</a> was just released. And there's a sentence in the document that's very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
As soon as the next preview of the .NET Framework 4.5 is available we will be shipping EF 5.0 Beta 1, which will include all these new features.
</blockquote>

<p>Does it mean that the version that will ship with .NET Framework 4.5 (the next version in time of writing this post) is going to be <i>5.0</i>? I still clearly recall the mess the <em>second</em> version with version number <em>4.0</em> created - a lot of people, on my trainings, talks, ..., confused. What happened to clear <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2011/08/09/ef-releases-amp-versioning-call-for-feedback.aspx">versioning strategy</a>?</p>

<p>I hope it's just a small miss/typo and the version will be Entity Framework 4.5 and the following (additive) updates will be 4.5+n.</p>
