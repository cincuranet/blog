I'm so looking forward to this year's [.NET Developer Days][1]. I think it's my favorite conference of the year. The current state of the world is not best for conferences, but I hope the #netdd is going to happen at least as planned now. And although the conference is now also online, if the situation permits, I'll try to be there in-person.

<!-- excerpt -->

> **Update:** The conference will be online only, hence all the in-person stuff does not apply. But, not only the sessions will be online, also the workshops(!).

This year I'll be doing special pre-con _Mastering Entity Framework Core_.

> In this hands-on workshop we'll refresh some basics and then dive deep into all the mappings and variations you can do to either make the model, your classes, look the way you want or to match as nicely as possible existing database structure.

And also, post-con _Async/Await Understanding and Effective Usage_.

> This deep-dive hands-on workshop will explain the core concepts, you'll understand why is something done the way it's done and finally we'll apply it to real world problems and understand the most common mistakes people make.

Both are hands-on workshops, where I'll supercharge your knowledge about the topic. If you're interested [click here][3] and register. The seats are limited.

Besides the pre-con and post-con I'll do also two sessions during [main conference][4] - _EF Core 5.0 - what's new_ and _C# Source Generators - let the machine do the programming_. I'll be happy to see you there (in-person or online).

> A leap around new features and ideas in Entity Framework Core 5.0.

> Source Generators are one of longest requested features in C# language. What is a source generator? What I can use it for? Also what I can't use it for? Answers to these and more in this session.

Last but not least, I'll have some [_tabs over spaces buffs_][2] with me ðŸ™Œ, so first come (or reserve) first served!
