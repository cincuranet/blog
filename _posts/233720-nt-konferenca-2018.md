In less than a month (22nd-24th of May 2018) the biggest Slovenian conference - [NT konferenca 2018][1] - will happen. It is the 23rd edition, amazing. And I'm so stoked to be part of it with my session about [Entity Framework Core 2.0 and 2.1][2]. 
 
<!-- excerpt -->

> Entity Framework Core 2.0 has been introduced recently together with .NET Core 2 and ASP.NET Core 2. What's new? What are the changes to version 1.0/1.1? Does it make sense to use version 2.0? What about 2.1? Is it filling the gaps? What's new there. Plus. What are the more advanced features, what are its limitations ... What about, for example, using with databases other than MS SQL Server?
