I'll be speaking on [MS Dev Summit 2021][1] (online) this Friday about _Azure Storage (maybe) hidden features_. 

<!-- excerpt -->

> Azure Storage is a basic tool for storing your data in Azure. But it has more features than just simply that. In this session well check some, maybe hidden ones, that might become handy in some scenarios.
