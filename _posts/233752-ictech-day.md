I almost forgot to tell you about this. This week, Thursday, I'm speaking at [ICTech Day][1] in Belgium. And about the topics I'm very passionate about. First session is ["Tasks and Await from the ground up"][2] and other is ["Async and Await"][3]. If you're in the area, maybe you can still try to make time and come (you have to be a guest of somebody from PeopleWare or Elmos).

<!-- excerpt -->

> Tasks are great. You can write on a few, or even a single, line what took before maybe at least 20 lines. How are tasks related to good old threads? And what is await doing? Is it using threads? Is there a difference between asynchronous code and multithreaded code...

> Async and await seem to be just a few new keywords, but what's behind? How is the code actually executed? Can we learn something from this background info and improve our code on top of that? And why would you even consider using async/await...
