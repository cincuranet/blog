<p>Though Entity Framework 4 doesn't support bulk action, you can do it. As <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/matthieu">Matthieu Mezil</a> <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/matthieu/archive/2010/05/12/bulk-delete-with-ef4.aspx">shows, it's possible</a>. Nice piece of code, Matthieu.</p>

<p>If you don't wanna play with it and go straight, you can create a stored procedure for action you need to call it. That's how I'm doing it. Maybe in next version of EF somebody will think about bulk actions and we'll see it.</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/matthieu/archive/2010/05/21/bulk-delete-v3.aspx">v3</a>/<a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/matthieu/archive/2010/05/27/bulk-delete-v4.aspx">v4</a> is pretty awesome. It's really going through a lot of options and dealing with it. Worth at least looking at it and quickly thinking about it.</p>
