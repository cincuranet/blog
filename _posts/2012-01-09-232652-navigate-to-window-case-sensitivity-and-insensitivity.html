<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio">Visual Studio</a>'s Navigate To window (Ctrl+,) is a very fast way to navigate in your files, classes etc. Few days ago I accidentally found a "feature". I always started typing with first letter in upper case and after few characters I messed it up by typing letter in wrong case and missing object I was looking for. I was trying to find a way to make it do the search case insensitively.</p>

<p>And it's actually pretty easy. As long as you type using lower case, it's case insensitive. Using upper case once, turns it to case sensitive mode. No settings needed. Easy. I like it.</p>
