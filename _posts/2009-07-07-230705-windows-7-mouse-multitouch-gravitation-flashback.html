<p>While reading <a href="http://mtaulty.com">Mike Taulty's</a> posts about playing with <a href="http://mtaulty.com/CommunityServer/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/archive/2009/07/06/windows-7-experimenting-with-multi-touch-on-windows-7-part-1.aspx">Windows 7 and multitouch</a> some words like deceleration, inertia etc. started some process in my head and I recalled some very old program everybody was creating. I don't know if everybody, but at least 99,9% of Delphi developers.</p>

<p>The idea behind program was pretty simple. No window, somehow hook the mouse (I don't remember whether it was classic hook, because it was in Win98/95 era). And everytime you put the mouse to the top, it started falling down, like if the gravitation worker for mouse cursor too.  I remember too some modification, that if you done some horizontal move with mouse it had some inertia and decelerated. So it was fun try to click on some button or similar stuff. :) And if you put the mouse to the top of the screen with this move, it was falling down with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola">parabola</a> path.</p>

<p>Sure, the code and/or program was absolutely useless, but it was a great rest during long day at work. I wish I found the program somewhere now and look at it. :)</p>
