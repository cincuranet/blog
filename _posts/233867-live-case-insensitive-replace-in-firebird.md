I'm planning to do next livestream 18 August from 18:00 CEST. The topic is _Case insensitive replace in Firebird_. 

<!-- excerpt -->

About a year ago I received an email from happy developer using [_FbNetExternalEngine_][1] telling me how difficult it is to do case insensitive replace in SQL in Firebird and how easy it was via C#/.NET and _FbNetExternalEngine_. I personally never needed case insensitive replace in SQL, but I can try that live. We'll see. And surely, I'll do it in C#/.NET too. You can then compare the two solutions.
