It turned out, that the previous maintainer of <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/log4net">log4net NuGet package</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/dotnetjunky">@dotnetjunky</a> was assigned mistakenly. So nobody was actually maintaining that package. After few messages with him, we decided, I'll take over the ownership and maintain it. 

I still use <a href="http://nlog-project.org/">NLog</a> in my projects, as I like it a little bit more. But I know, there's big community around log4net, with my coworker <a href="http://rarous.net/">Ales</a> included. :)

Today I uploaded package with new version 1.2.11 [1], and I'll try my best to keep the package up-to-date. Enjoy.

<small>[1] I used the binaries <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html#two-snks">signed with new key</a> so any new dependencies will follow this recommended usage.</small>
