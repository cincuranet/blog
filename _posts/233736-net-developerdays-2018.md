In less than two months the [.NET DeveloperDays 2018][1] conference will happen. According to the organizers it's "the biggest event in Central and Eastern Europe dedicated exclusively to application development on the .NET platform" and I'm excited to speak there together with other great [speakers][2].

<!-- excerpt -->

I have prepared two sessions. First one is [Entity Framework Core 2+ - What's New and How to Use It][3] and the other is [Turn on Turbo Mode for Your Visual Studio Usage and Debugging][4]. Meet me there, I'm happy to chat with all of you.

> Over the last few releases of EF Core the team has made some significant forward move and EF Core is now a viable option for OR mapping in .NET Core applications. In this session I'll show you what's new in version 2.x (or whatever the number will be at that time) and how to start using it in you (not only) .NET Core applications.

> Visual Studio has a overwhelming number of shortcuts and debugging features. Careful usage of these can make your life easier and allow you to work faster. I'll show you the most useful shortcuts and debugging features. After this will no longer move you hand between keyboard and mouse nor you'll consider any code navigation or manipulation extensions.
