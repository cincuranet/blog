In couple of days [Techorama in Utrecht][1] is going to happen. This year's theme is _funfair_. This I was lucky and [2 of my sessions][2] were selected.

<!-- excerpt -->

First one is _How to customize EF Core queries_.

> Entity Framework's query pipeline is extremely flexible. In fact you can alter how the SQL queries are generated in various places. In this session I'll show you the places where you can jump in and alter the queries.

And other one is _SIMD, vectorization - what it means and how to do it in .NET_.

> Vector instruction is the latest trend from CPU manufacturers. And vectorization in the code is another way to squeeze more out of the code. But what exactly is it? How does it work? And how to do it in .NET? Don't worry, we'll talk about everything.

Hope to meet you there.
