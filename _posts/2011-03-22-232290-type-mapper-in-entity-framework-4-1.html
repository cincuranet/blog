<p>Even if you <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-03-21-232283-removing-all-conventions-in-entity-framework-4-1-code-first %}">remove all conventions</a> when using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg232765.aspx">Code First</a> you might get errors from Entity Framework about not being able to properly map some items. The reason is <i>type mapper</i>. In RC (and very probably in RTM as well) it's not implemented as convention, hence always kicks in.</p>

<p>In this case the <code>Ignore</code> method comes into play. For instance I have in my code property:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
public CultureInfo Locale
{
	get { ... }
	set { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>and I'm not mapping it at any place. But Entity Framework will still complain about pieces of <code>CultureInfo</code> not being properly mapped. But in <code>EntityTypeConfiguration</code> can make Entity Framework to ignore it. For example:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
class FooBarConfiguration : EntityTypeConfiguration&lt;FooBar&gt;
{
	public FooBarConfiguration()
	{
		// ...
		this.Ignore(x =&gt; x.Locale);

		this.Map(...);
	}
}
</pre>

<p>At first I was confused, but after quick email exchange with EF team the "issue" was clear.</p>
