But, sadly, there's something missing, mainly due to huge refactoring.</p>

<p>I hit the wall with one in particular. It's entity splitting together with TPH inheritance. If you try to map it, you'll get <code>Entity splitting cannot be specified for type '&lt;entity type&gt;' since it is part of an inheritance hierarchy.</code>. Bummer. So one of the projects I'm working on now, is stuck in CTP4. :)</p> 

<p>On the other hand, the good news (from reliable source ;)) is, that in RTM this will be working fine.</p>
