<p>Maybe it's related to <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2010-06-26-231706-new-kindle-firmware-2-5-reflections %}">new firmware</a>, but today I noticed, that my Kindle no longer limits access to web only to selected sites (<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon</a>, ...). I'm able to access any page I want (here in Czech Republic). <a href="http://www.id3renamer.com">ID3 renamer</a>'s site works, this blog as well. I don't know whether it's written somewhere and I just missed it, but I do like it.</p>
