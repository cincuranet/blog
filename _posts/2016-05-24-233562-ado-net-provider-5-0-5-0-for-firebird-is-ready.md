New 5.0.5.0 version of [ADO.NET provider for Firebird][1] is ready for download. As with every major release the changes of something going wrong are high. No exception here. Big thanks to people testing the provider and reporting bugs.

Also as I was there, my brain being in high power state, I fixed some bugs (though it was only few, these span well in the codebase). 

<!-- excerpt -->

Overview of changes can be found in [tracker][4].

You can get the bits from NuGet [FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient][2] and [EntityFramework.Firebird][3] (or from [firebirdsql.org][1]).
