In less than a month (21st-23rd of May 2019) the biggest Slovenian conference - [NT konferenca 2019][1] - will happen. And I'm so stoked to be part of it with my session about [What to expect from Entity Framework Core 3.0 and Entity Framework 6.3][2].

<!-- excerpt -->

> Entity Framework Core 3.0 is just around the corner and as a next major version one can expect some nice new features and improvements. In this sessions we will look at those and also what the old-new Entity Framework 6.3 brings to the table.
