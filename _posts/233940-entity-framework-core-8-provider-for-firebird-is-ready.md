I'm excited to announce the release of Entity Framework Core 8 provider for Firebird.

<!-- excerpt -->

Although Entity Framework Core 8 comes with new features, not all of those are supported on Firebird (i.e. because Firebird lacks JSON functions at the moment). As with the previous version, I [streamed][3], in this instance some parts of, the process.

Overview of all the changes can be found in [here][2] and you can get the bits from NuGet [FirebirdSql.EntityFrameworkCore.Firebird][1].
