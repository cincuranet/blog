Next week [Techorama in Antwerp][1] is going to happen. And I'm looking forward to _all-star sports edition_. I was lucky and [2 of my sessions][2] were selected.

<!-- excerpt -->

First one is _Optimize your EF Core update actions_.

> Everybody optimizes queries. Boring. But there's a big chunk of applications where updates (inserts, deletes) are as common as queries and need to perform well. This session will show you what you can (and shouldn't) do to make it happen.

And other one is _SynchronizationContext and ConfigureAwait - more than you need to know_.

> ConfigureAwait(false) is a little dark magic in .NET. Together with SynchronizationContext it's often misunderstood and incorrectly used. In this session we'll build strong understanding what's really going on and we'll then apply it to every day async/await work.

Hope to meet you there.
