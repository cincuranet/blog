[WUG Days][1] jdou i letos do Prahy. Jedna moje session byla vybrána, takže se společně podíváme na _parameterized collections_ v EF Core. 

<!-- excerpt -->

_Lessons learned from translating parameterized collections in EF Core_

> EF Core 10 now supports 3 modes of how to translate parameterized collection. Why 3? Well because we learned that the previous 2 are not good. Why? This is what this session is about. And is the 3rd one finally correct? Come to the session to know. Spoiler alert, it all boils down to performance.
