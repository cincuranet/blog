I think the whole iPhone SDK knows I'm from the other side of the barricade. :D What else would explain the error I faced today after less than a minute when working in Interface Builder.

On the other hand I was brave enough to send the error report (as I was able to reproduce it quite easily), so maybe it'll be fixed in next version. Good turn? Anyway sooner or later I'll convince the machine that I'm not a bad guy.
