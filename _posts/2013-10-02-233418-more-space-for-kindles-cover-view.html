<p>When I bought (<a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2012-11-06-233049-kindle-5-paperwhite-2nd-round %}">link</a>, <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2012-10-17-233024-kindle-5-paperwhite-review %}">link</a>) the Kindle 5 Paperwhite the <i>Cover View</i> was one part of the new UI. And I found it not that much usable. Basically half of the space was occupied with <i>Recommended Content</i>. Though the recommendations are often a good match (say hello to data-mining) it was just using a lot of space. So I - as I wrote in posts linked above - stoped using this view and used the old view with just text and lines.</p>

<p>But yesterday I was aimlessly jumping in Kindle's menus to kill some time because I was not in a mood to read yet. And I found something. In <i>Settings</i> - <i>Device Options</i> - <i>Personalize your Kindle</i> there's a switch <i>Recommended Content</i>. Voil√†. Turn that off and the whole screen is now occupied with book covers. Well hidden.</p>

<p>Still don't know whether I like the <i>Cover View</i> more, but it's for sure more usable now. What view are you using?</p>
