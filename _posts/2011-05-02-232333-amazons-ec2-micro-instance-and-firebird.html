<p>Few months ago I was playing with different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> providers and I was also considering deploying the application to some "small instance" cloud. I came to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2010/09/09/announcing-micro-instances-for-amazon-ec2/">Micro Instance</a> of Amazon EC2. Part of the solution I was doing research for is <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird database</a> and because the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">pricing</a> looks good, I tried to install Firebird (2.5 SuperClassic) on this instance.</p> 

<p>The good news is, that it's possible. As I did manual install, it was fast. The bad news is, that it's really slow. If you read the description of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Micro Instance</a> you can expect it will not be blazing fast. But even for really low-load database server it's almost unusable.</p>

<p>I'm not saying you can't use it. Maybe some slow/late backup/mirror or something like that should be doable. But for normal applications using database server you'll do better job with your own server or VPS.</p>
