<p>Looks like there are two groups of developers. One writing <code>ID</code> and one writing </code>Id</code>. I'm in the first one, and I'm even not 100% sure why (except because my feelings are saying me, it's "more" correct). But it looks like there's no conclusion.</p>

<p>More and more I see the other option being used often (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext.aspx"><code>DbContext</code></a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpapplication.aspx"><code>HttpApplication</code></a> to name a few), especially if you take into account properties like <code>URL</code> and so on. It even looks this is more common inside <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">.NET Framework</a>, but still, i.e. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.dbnull.aspx"><code>DBNull</code></a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.aspx"><code>System.Web.UI</code></a> is an exception. Who knows...</p>

<p>Anyway, I'd like to ask you. What are your habits? Have you find some good pros (or cons) for one or the other? Or articles/papers/... about this naming? Share your thoughts in comments.</p>

In "<a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/framework-design-guidelines-conventions-ebook/B001868XIQ/B0017SWPNO">Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries (2nd Edition)</a>" I've found (<a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/post/yf-A47m2S7WC6KD4RSgbVQ">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Two other terms that are in common usage are in a category by themselves, because they are common slang abbreviations. The two words Ok and Id (and they should be cased as shown) are the exceptions to the guideline that no abbreviations should be used in names.</p></blockquote>

<p>Solved. On the other hand the <code>DbContext</code> and <code>DBNull</code> is still weird inconsistency.</p>
