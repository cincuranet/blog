As I promised during my session "Turn on Turbo Mode for Your Visual Studio Usage and Debugging" on [.NET DeveloperDays 2018][1], I'm posting the shortcuts I was showing.

<!-- excerpt -->  

But, first thing first. The Ctrl-Alt-Down and Ctrl-Alt-Up shortcuts were not working, as I was [told][2], because the system-wide graphics card driver shortcuts were eating it. Stupid driver. Here are both really in action.

Ctrl-Alt-Down:

![Ctrl-Alt-Down]({% include post_ilink, post: page, name: "ctrl-alt-down.gif" %})

Ctrl-Alt-Up:

![Ctrl-Alt-Up]({% include post_ilink, post: page, name: "ctrl-alt-up.gif" %})    

So here are the shorcuts, without description, thus you have to try them, hopefully learning some during. ;)
