<p>I was writing some return type from function when I got <del>brilliant</del> dumb idea to start playing with braces, question marks etc. :) And I came with some self-competition to write a lot of different characters into a valid type definition (in C#, of course). <i>And simple repeating doesn't count.</i> But why not to create this as a public competition. ;) </p>

<p>With the short first try I ended up with this:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
IEnumerable&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;int, int?&gt;?[,]&gt;
</pre>

<p>That's probably not the best what can be done. Do you have better idea? OK, it's your turn. Use comments. The best - I'm the referee - will get the lolipop.</p>
