I'll be talking about _Most Common Mistakes in Using Tasks and in Asynchronous Code_ as part of _Svitla Smart Talk_ event. It will be streamed 22 September, 19:00 (Kyiv time/UTC+3) and it's free. There's a generous 30 minute window for Q&A at the end and I'll try to asnwer as much questions as possible. You can register [here][1]. Hope to see you there.
