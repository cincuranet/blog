I recently did a technical review of book from [Packt Publishing][1] (actually I reviewed some chapters, not all). It's called [Entity Framework 4.1: Expert's Cookbook][2].

Because I haven't read it thoroughly during my review, there are some chapters I have no idea what's inside. The book contains a lot of samples and in a Test Driven Development style. First the test is provided and then the code. It's really a developer's cookbook. You don't have to read a lot of paragraphs to see what's going on. Just read the test, check the code and if everything is clear, go to next one. If not, there's a short explanation after the code.

Though I'm not the author and I'm not familiar with the book completely, I'd like to hear your opinions. Maybe in the future I'll write one as well and this might be good learning.
