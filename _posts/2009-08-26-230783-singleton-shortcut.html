<p>Probably every developer sometimes heard about the singleton pattern. I'll be not far from truth that you're probably writing it like this:</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
class Foo1
{
	private static Foo1 _instance;

	public static Foo1 Instance
	{
		get
		{
			if (_instance == null)
				_instance = new Foo1();

			return _instance;
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<p>I do it same way. But today I seen little bit different way. It's using the C# coalesing operator and some C-like magic syntax.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
class Foo2
{
	private static Foo2 _instance;

	public static Foo2 Instance
	{
		get
		{
			return _instance ?? (_instance = new Foo2());
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<p>Looks cool, isn't it? On the other hand I'll probably use the first one, as it's more readable, at least for me.</p>
