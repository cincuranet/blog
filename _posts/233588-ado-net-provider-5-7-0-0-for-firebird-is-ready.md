New version 5.7.0.0 of [ADO.NET provider for Firebird][1] is ready for download. The previous one added .NET Core support and although on the outside not much changed, there was quite a storm inside. As you can guess some bugs slipped into the version. The 5.7.0.0 is thus full of bugfixes inside, without any visible changes outside.

<!-- excerpt -->

Overview of changes can be found in [tracker][4].

You can get the bits from NuGet [FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient][2] and [EntityFramework.Firebird][3] (or from [firebirdsql.org][1]).
