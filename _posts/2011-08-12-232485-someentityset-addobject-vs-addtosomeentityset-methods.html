Is it better to call <code>ObjectContext.SomeEntitySet.AddObject()</code> or <code>ObjectContext.AddToSomeEntitySet()</code>? Short answer is: It doesn't matter. 

Long answer. The AddToSomeEntitySet method calls <code>base.AddObject("SomeEntitySet", someEntitySet);</code>, you can see it from generated code. The other method calls <code>base.Context.AddObject(this.FullyQualifiedEntitySetName, entity);</code>. Hence it's almost the same. Only difference is in <code>FullyQualifiedEntitySetName</code> property that is used. So it <i>might</i> be little bit slower, but I think it's unmesurable difference. Also take into account other parts of your application, honestly, where you're probably wasting more time.  8-)

<i>What's your preferred call?</i>
