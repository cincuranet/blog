<p>Wondering what changed on Earth in last, say, four weeks. I'm getting more than average (read: more than zero) emails, asking whether FirebirdClient works with InterBase. Similarly in mailing list.</p>

<p>Well, the short answer is no. The long: FirebirdClient is created as part of Firebird project. Hence it's focused on Firebird. And even both Firebird and InterBase have same history, now the engines, and more in future, are more and more different. So it may work (with some tweaks) with current versions of InterBase, but it's tested with (sponsored by, focused on) Firebird only.</p>
