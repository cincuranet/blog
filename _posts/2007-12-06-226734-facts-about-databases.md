* Use Firebird SQL Server, if you have the luxury to choose among many database systems. ([http://www.firebirdsql.org/][1])
* If you want to deal with the COMPLEXITY, try PostgreSQL Server. ([http://www.postgresql.org/][2])
* MySQL is trying to become a "proper" database system on VERSION 5 (For God's sake!). ([http://www.mysql.com/][3])
* If you fancy a POSH database system, try Oracle. It has express version available for free; check the licence details. ([http://www.oracle.com/][4])
* If you are walking on the road, bricks of which are laid by Microsoft, I need not say anything; you are already using M$ SQL Server 200x. ([http://www.microsoft.com/sql/][5])
