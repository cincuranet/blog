I'm happy to bring you early Christmas gift packed as ADO.NET provider for Firebird version 2.7. This version brings important bug fixes ([tracker.firebirdsql.org][1]) and [logging improvements][2].

This release wouldn't be possible without support of people/companies using provider actively. Big thanks to them.

You can download it at [www.firebirdsql.org][3] or use [NuGet package][4].

Enjoy!
