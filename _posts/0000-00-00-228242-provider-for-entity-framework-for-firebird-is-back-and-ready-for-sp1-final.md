The final version of SP1 for VS2008 and .NET 3.5 is out for a while. And you may noticed, that there were some [changes][1] between SP1 beta and SP1 final. These changes are happily not huge as between EF Beta 3 and SP1 Beta 1.

So if you want to test new version of FirebirdClient working with SP1 check the [weekly builds][2].
