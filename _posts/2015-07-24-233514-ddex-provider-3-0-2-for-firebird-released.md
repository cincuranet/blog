[Compared to Visual Studio 2013 this time I'm faster][2]. The 3.0.2 version of DDEX provider for Firebird brings support for Visual Studio 2015. The installer has been updated and also the `*.reg` files in sources in case you'd like to install manually.

You can download it from [FirebirdSQL.org site][1].
