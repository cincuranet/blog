<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.objects.objectstatemanager.aspx">ObjectStateManager</a> contains a lot of information about entities currently in context. In fact it contains complete entities too. So you can try to look into it before issuing query and use it as <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2009-02-22-229047-local-queries-2nd-edition %}">local cache</a>. For some simple cases, like PK match, you can create extension method in no time.</p>

<p>But in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=4e094902-aeff-4ee2-a12d-5881d4b0dd3e">current feature pack</a> for Entity Framework 4 if you're using new <code>DbSet</code> object you can find <code>Find</code> method, which does exactly this.</p>

<p>You provide PK value (or values if it's composite) and it'll first look for that object locally and if not found it'll try to fetch it from database.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
using (testEntities ent = new testEntities())
{
	var data = ent.Masters.Select(x =&gt; x.ID).Take(1).First();

	var item1 = ent.Masters.FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.ID == data);
	// Find method will find it locally, no querying will be done
	var item2 = ent.Masters.Find(data);
}

using (testEntities ent = new testEntities())
{
	var data = ent.Masters.Select(x =&gt; x.ID).Take(1).First();

	//var item1 = ent.Masters.FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.ID == data);
	// here the Find method will not find it and will query database
	var item2 = ent.Masters.Find(data);
}
</pre>

<p>It's nothing from what you'll be excited couple of hours, but every little counts.</p>
