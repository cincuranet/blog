<p>The <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/">VMWare Workstation</a> <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2009-11-05-231002-vmware-workstation-7-and-visual-studio-2010-rendering-problem %}">had a problem with Visual Studio 2010 rendering (in fact all WPF apps were affected) when the hardware graphic acceleration was turned on</a>. But since <a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/ws71/doc/releasenotes_ws71.html">version 7.1</a> this is no longer true.</p>

<p>Recently I updated my virtual machine (VMWare Workstation 7.1 + new VMWare Tools + turning graphic acceleration on) with Visual Studio 2010 and the rendering is correct. Finally I'll enjoy the graphic card accelerated machine and lighten up CPU.</p>
