What's better than finding what you need to fix for upcoming release of product? :-) I get finally Visual Studio 2010 CTP up and running and decided to test whether DDEX provider for Firebird is working fine with it (else I need to find why not and fix these issues). Luckily it's working fine. I've changed reg files appropriately for VS2010 and modified machine.config for .NET FW 4.0. No problem, 10 minutes and it was done.

Check this out. Nice, isn't it? :-)
