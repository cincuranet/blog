During December I finished building my new PC. My previous PC was not terribly dated or slow (and continues to be used by my wife), but I felt it's favorable time for update. It's not balls to wall build, rather something I think is good for my workflow - mostly development and related tasks. I don't edit movies, stream (or play for that matter) games, etc. I describe each component (in no particular order) and my reasoning why I chose it, your mileage may obviously vary.

<!-- excerpt -->

#### CPU

_AMD Ryzen 7 5800X_. I was thinking about _5900X_, but I think I wouldn't be able to fully use all the cores and hence _5800X_ it was. Also, I was extremely lucky, the most common e-shops here where I was looking for _5800X_ (or _5900X_) were not having any in stock and the restocking was unknown, but one B2B distributor had _5800X_ in stock. When I found out I immediately placed the order - at 22:47 on Saturday. :)
If you're wondering why not _Intel_... Last time I used _AMD_ CPUs was in "486" era, but I felt I need to try _AMD_ again (you know to have some excitement). I **also** think the _Zen 3_ architecture really pushes the bar.

#### Motherboard

_ASUS TUF Gaming B550-PLUS_. I went for B550 chipset because I don't need much of extra cards and hence X570 seemed overkill. My previous PC used _ASUS_ motherboard and I had no issues with it, I went for _ASUS_ again.

#### RAM

_Kingston HyperX Fury DDR4 64GB (Kit 2x32GB) 3200MHz CL16 DIMM 1.35V_. I wanted 64GB in two sticks, dual rank at 3200MHz, CL16. And this one was in stock and very reasonably priced. I ran _MemTest86_ for almost 24 hours when the build was done, and the RAM passed.

#### SSD

_Samsung 980 PRO 500GB NVMe M.2_ . Because it's PCIe 4.0. And although in last 10+ years I used _Intel_ SSDs, I think this is better option.

#### Cooler

_Noctua NH-U12S SE-AM4_. I'm big fan (no pun intended) of Noctua products. Both because of performance and reliability. And although I'm not a professional PC builder, the research on _NH-U12S_ looked like it's going to be more than fine and so far, I haven't even seen the fan going to full speed.

#### PSU

_Corsair RM550x_. I used it before, again no issues. For my build 550W is enough and I like the _zero RPM_ feature. 80 Plus Gold certification doesn't hurt either.

#### Case

_Fractal Design Define S_. I don't mind the look and my PC is purely functional, it's not for looks in any way. Simple black block.

#### GPU

_GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1650 D6 WINDFORCE OC 4G_. Frankly I have no idea what I'm doing here. I don't need much from GPU. Bit of OBS? Visual Studio? Word? Excel? Firefox? YouTube? Vimeo? SMPlayer? In my last PC I used integrated _Intel HD 630_ and my workflow was never affected. If the _5800X_ would exist with integrated GPU I would go that way. I know everybody is crazy now about the "3090", "3080" and so on, but I literally have no idea what I would use that GPU for... The "1650" seemed good enough, was in stock, and with decent price. But again, I have no idea what I'm doing here and how my workflow would benefit from better GPU.

#### Summary

I know everybody has its own needs and this build doesn't aim to be "reasonable", "budget", "performance" or something like that. I'm not a professional PC builder, I went on what felt like it would make my life - as a developer; day and night - more pleasant. I might be wrong. I would also trade stability over performance (the PC waits for my brain/fingers most of the time anyway) anytime (the PC runs smooth - knock on wood - so far).
