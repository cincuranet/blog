<p>The <a href="{% post_url 2012-01-05-232642-kindle-4-touch-review %}">Kindle 4 Touch</a> has, as expected, new (improved) browser experience. It's pretty good in fact, for quick look and read on some pages or for reading articles in your <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a site owner, you may want to know accesses from Kindle to your site (i.e. to provide simplified version). The <code>User-Agent</code> for Kindle 4 Touch with latest firmware (in time of writing this post - <code>Kindle 5.0.0 (1370280073)</code>) is:</p>

<pre class="brush:plain">
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux armv7l like Android; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.2+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0 Safari/533.2+ Kindle/3.0+
</pre>

<p>Probably the interesting piece is <code>Kindle/3.0+</code>, so you can distinguish previous <a href="{% post_url 2010-09-08-231986-identification-of-kindle-browser %}">Kindle 3</a>.</p>
