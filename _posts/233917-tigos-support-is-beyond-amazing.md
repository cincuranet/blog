I recently put Tigo optimizers under remaining solar panels on my roof and also equiped my system with CCA (and TAP). During the whole process I contacted support few times and I was blown away by the quality of it. I don't think I've ever had such an overwhelmingly good experience dealing with support.

<!-- excerpt -->

Even before I went all in into Tigo, I contacted support with some technical questions, to make sure my system design was sound and would work. And although you might say during pre-sales everybody is helpful (for obvious reasons), the answers I was given were beyond helpful and useful. I felt like they really wanted to help me and make sure I understood the answers.

Then I had a issue with CCA. As it turned out, the CCA was faulty and replacement was sent to me. Nothing out of ordinary. But. All this happened between December 25 and 31! I was fully expecting my request to be processed in January, like any sane person would. But no. I received initial response in 24 hours, in next day or two the problem was diagnosed and then the replacement was shipped. I was back in business first week in January.

And finally one of the optimizers was behaving strangely and I again contacted support. Although the issue turned out to be difficult and took longer to diagnose (see picture below), support really took the ownership of my problem. The engagement was beyond anything I've ever experienced.

What's the conclusion? I really feel like a valued customer and would recommend [Tigo Energy][1] anytime. Big thanks to support team, especially Najeeb Alkish.
