Few days ago we [started using `#efhelp` hashtag for Entity Framework related questions][1]. It's starting well so far, but there was one small problem. Without a support from client application you can't follow hashtag. That leaves you with the search "solution".

To make it little bit more pleasant for people interested in `#efhelp`, I created a simple bot, that retweets everything with `#efhelp` under [@EFHelp][2] account. Hence now you can follow this account to be in picture. Also note that posting to that account does nothing because it's not actively monitored.
