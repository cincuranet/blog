<p>If you're looking to some articles/resources/documents you may find, that "greater than or equal" or "lower than or equal" operators have keywords <code>gteq</code> or <code>lteq</code>. But when you try these, the request fails.</p>
<p>Well, the simple reason is, that these operators are in fact <code>ge</code> or <code>le</code>. Hope this helps you save some time when trying to find out what's wrong.</p>
