Well, not so back as you might think, but the incompatibility between Beta 3 and SP1 Beta 1 is gone. I've done some new methods etc. so it's now at least able to work in totally simple cases. In next weeks I'll try to review all the changes and push the support little bit further. You can download current state from [weekly builds][1].
