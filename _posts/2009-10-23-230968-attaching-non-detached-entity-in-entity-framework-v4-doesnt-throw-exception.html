<p>While slowly digging into Beta 2 of EF4 I discovered new nice "feature". In EF1, if you had code like this.</p>

<pre class="brush:csharp">
master[] data;
using (testovaciEntities ent = new testovaciEntities())
{
	data = ent.masters.ToArray();
}
using (testovaciEntities ent = new testovaciEntities())
{
	foreach (master item in data)
	{
		ent.Attach(item);
	}
}
</pre>

<p>It threw <code>InvalidOperationException</code> saying <code>An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker.</code>. Right but I don't have access to my previous context anymore. This behavior caused me a lot of headache and I created couple of hacks to workaround it. But the good news is that the code above works fine in EF4.</p> 

<p>Neat! Together with other improvements I can get rid of my hacks and sleep well again. ;)</p>
