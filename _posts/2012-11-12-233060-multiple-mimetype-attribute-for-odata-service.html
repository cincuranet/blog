<p>I was recently doing my course on Entity Framework (<a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>, if you're interested) and the last day we were diving into WCF Data Services aka OData.</p> 

<p>There's a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.services.mimetypeattribute.aspx">MimeType attribute</a> that allows you, simply speaking, set the MIME type for the output of some operation. That's great, because you can immediately provide i.e. <code>text/html</code> output where the HTML is saved in come column in database. But it's a fair need to want to specify the MIME type for operations you have. Sadly the MimeType attribute has to be on class and has <code>AllowMultiple = false</code>. Bummer.</p>

<p>After some poking around, research etc. I found that there's indeed a limitation that you currently cannot specify the MIME type for more than one operation. But good news is, that in future release(s) this limitation should be lifted.</p> 

<p>Wondering how's possible I never thought about this myself before??? :)</p>
